***HydraDX Omnipool - An Ocean of Liquidity for Polkadot Trade an abundance of assets in a single pool. The HydraDX Omnipool is efficient, sustainable and trustless.***

## Conceptual and Technical Overview of HydraDX Protocol

### Conceptual Foundation

HydraDX is a multi-asset liquidity protocol built on the Substrate framework, enabling cross-chain asset swaps with automated market-making (AMM) mechanisms. At its core, HydraDX seeks to address the fragmentation of liquidity across numerous decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by aggregating assets into a single liquidity pool, termed the Omnipool. This innovative approach simplifies the trading process, offering users seamless access to a diversified range of assets while minimizing slippage and enhancing capital efficiency.

### Technical Architecture

The HydraDX protocol is underpinned by a robust technical architecture that harmonizes various components, ensuring fluid interoperability, scalability, and security. Key elements include:

- **Omnipool**: Central to the HydraDX ecosystem, the Omnipool consolidates liquidity for all supported assets into a unified pool. This design facilitates direct swaps between any asset pair without the need for a double swap, thus optimizing transaction costs and efficiency.

- **Automated Market Making (AMM)**: HydraDX utilizes a mathematically driven AMM model to determine asset prices based on supply and demand dynamics within the Omnipool. This model adjusts prices dynamically to maintain equilibrium and ensure fair trading conditions.

- **Asset Management**: Assets within the HydraDX protocol are meticulously managed to ensure seamless integration and operability. This involves the registration of new assets, governance oversight on tradable assets, and the maintenance of asset state and reserves.

- **Liquidity Provision and NFTs**: Users contribute to the Omnipool by providing liquidity in exchange for pool shares represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These NFTs encapsulate the ownership and value of the provided liquidity, allowing for flexible management and withdrawal.

- **Mathematical Operations**: At the heart of HydraDX are sophisticated mathematical operations that calculate liquidity adjustments, trade impacts, fees, and slippage. These operations ensure that the protocol remains balanced, efficient, and aligned with market conditions.

- **Governance and Safety Mechanisms**: Governance plays a pivotal role in the HydraDX protocol, with mechanisms in place for asset approval, tradability adjustments, and protocol upgrades. Additionally, safety features such as price barriers and external price oracles are implemented to protect against market manipulation and ensure transaction integrity.

- **Interoperability and Cross-chain Functionality**: Leveraging the Substrate framework, HydraDX is designed for cross-chain interoperability, facilitating asset swaps across different blockchain ecosystems. This expands the protocol's reach and utility, driving greater liquidity and user engagement.

#### Operational Flow

The operational flow within HydraDX centers around the seamless execution of trades, liquidity provision, and asset management within the Omnipool. Users interact with the protocol through a series of smart contracts and pallets that handle transactions, calculate optimal trading routes, and manage liquidity positions. The protocol employs a fee model to incentivize liquidity providers and support the ecosystem's sustainability.

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

In evaluating the HydraDX codebase, I adopted a systematic and thorough approach to dissect and understand the intricacies of its implementation. Given the multifaceted nature of the HydraDX protocol, encompassing smart contracts, liquidity pools, trading mechanisms, I initiated my examination with an overarching review of the documentation and architectural design. This foundational understanding provided a blueprint of the protocol's objectives, components, and intended interactions.

The initial step involves a comprehensive review of the project documentation, previous audit, technical specifications, and guidelines. This helps in understanding the intended functionalities, architecture, and the underlying mathematical models. It sets a foundation for a more in-depth code analysis by highlighting the core features, expected behaviors, and the overall structure of the project.

I then proceeded to dissect the codebase file by file, focusing first on the smart contracts, which are pivotal to the protocol's functionality. For each contract, I meticulously traced the logic of key functions, particularly those handling asset registration, liquidity provision, trade execution, and governance proposals. By mapping out the function calls and dependencies, I gained insights into the contracts' roles within the broader ecosystem and their interactions with one another.

To grasp the liquidity and trading mechanics, I delved into the mathematical models and algorithms underpinning these processes. This involved scrutinizing the formulas for liquidity addition and removal, price calculation, and trade execution. Understanding these algorithms was crucial for assessing the protocol's efficiency, security, and potential vulnerabilities.

Throughout this evaluation, I also considered security aspects, particularly in relation to smart contract vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow issues, and improper access controls. Assessing the codebase's testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, provided insights into the robustness of the code and the coverage of potential edge cases.








## Important functions

There are alot of important functions in hydraDX but following are the 5 most important fucntions according to me:

### 1. `add_liquidity(asset: AssetId, amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult`

**Description:**  
This function allows liquidity providers (LPs) to add liquidity to the omnipool for a specific asset. In return, LPs receive pool shares, represented as NFTs, proportional to the amount of liquidity provided. The function updates the pool's liquidity state, mints the corresponding NFT to represent the position, and emits events for tracking and governance purposes.

### 2. `remove_liquidity(position_id: PositionId, shares: Balance) -> DispatchResult`

**Description:**  
This function allows LPs to remove their liquidity from the pool by burning a specific amount of pool shares. The function calculates the amount of the underlying asset the LP is entitled to withdraw, updates the pool's liquidity state, burns the corresponding NFT shares, and updates the price oracle as necessary.

### 3. `sell(asset_in: AssetId, asset_out: AssetId, amount_in: Balance, min_amount_out: Balance) -> DispatchResult`

**Description:**  
Enables users to swap `asset_in` for `asset_out` by specifying the amount of `asset_in` they wish to trade and the minimum amount of `asset_out` they expect to receive. The function calculates the trade according to the pool's pricing algorithm, updates the pool's state, and applies the appropriate fees.

## Mathematical Operations

Below, I delve into the mathematical underpinnings of liquidity adjustments and trade execution within the Omnipool, incorporating equations to illustrate these concepts.

### Liquidity Adjustments

#### Adding Liquidity
When adding liquidity to the Omnipool, the proportion of the pool's total liquidity attributed to the liquidity provider is determined based on the following equation:

[![Code-Cogs-Eqn-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Jnm4sxVJ/Code-Cogs-Eqn-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/hJyqw9GP)

This equation ensures that the liquidity provider's share of the pool increases in proportion to the amount of liquidity they add, relative to the total liquidity.

#### Removing Liquidity
Conversely, when liquidity is removed from the pool, the decrease in the provider's share of the pool is calculated using an analogous equation:

[![Code-Cogs-Eqn-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nrKHpQw2/Code-Cogs-Eqn-2.png)](https://postimg.cc/K3zX54b3)

This equation ensures that the provider's share decreases only by the proportion of the liquidity they withdraw, maintaining fairness in the distribution of pool ownership.

### Trade Execution

#### Price Impact and Slippage
The price impact of a trade within the Omnipool, which affects slippage, is calculated using the constant product formula (or a variation thereof), common in AMM-based DEXs. The formula for the final price 

[![Code-Cogs-Eqn-5.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KjFpTKJR/Code-Cogs-Eqn-5.png)](https://postimg.cc/sQ6Jd2Fr)

This formula accounts for the increase in price due to the trade, which is directly proportional to the size of the trade relative to the pool's reserve.

#### Fee Application
Fees are applied to trades to compensate liquidity providers and are calculated as a percentage of the trade amount. 

[![Code-Cogs-Eqn-6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FszgBgdh/Code-Cogs-Eqn-6.png)](https://postimg.cc/Lnd1qP3W)
 
- The fee rate is a predetermined percentage set by the protocol.

This fee is then distributed among liquidity providers proportional to their share of the pool, incentivizing continued liquidity provision.

**NOTE: Since I wasn't able to write the Latex directly into the github so I used online tool and wrote it there and uploaded the image here**

## Test cases
Installed all the required dependencies with a single command 

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
```


### Build

Once the development environment is set up, builded the node. 
[Wasm](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Chopsticks

The easiest way to run and interact with HydraDX node was to use [Chopsticks](https://github.com/acalanetwork/chopsticks)

```Bash
npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest --config=launch-configs/chopsticks/hydradx.yml 
```

Now had a test node running at [`ws://localhost:8000`](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000#/explorer)

The test cases coverage I could see is 80% but this isn't a good coverage atleast 90% is recommended so it is recommeded to increase the test case coverage to atleast 90% to test the edge case scenerios.

   **Code Snippets:**
   ```rust
   // Add a new token to the Omnipool
   #[pallet::call_index(1)]
   pub fn add_token(origin: OriginFor<T>, ...) -> DispatchResult {
       T::AuthorityOrigin::ensure_origin(origin)?;
       ...
   }

   // Remove a token from the Omnipool
   #[pallet::call_index(12)]
   pub fn remove_token(origin: OriginFor<T>, asset_id: T::AssetId, ...) -> DispatchResult {
       T::AuthorityOrigin::ensure_origin(origin)?;
       ...
   }
   ```

   **Risk:** Unjustified addition or removal of assets could disrupt the market dynamics or favor specific parties.
