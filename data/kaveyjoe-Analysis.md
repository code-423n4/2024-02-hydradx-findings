# HydraDX Advanced Analysis Report

HydraDX Omnipool: An Ocean of Liquidity for Polkadot

## Introduction 
HydraDX is a cross-chain decentralized liquidity protocol that aims to become the ultimate DEX to help push DeFi into the mainstream. It was designed to facilitate frictionless liquidity in the DeFi space by leveraging a shared liquidity pool to host all assets. While other decentralized exchanges suffer from inefficiencies, such as high trading costs, HydraDX aims to address them through some innovations covered in this post.

HydraDX is a Substrate-based, permissionless, and open protocol on the Polkadot ecosystem governed by a strong community consisting of validators, liquidity providers, and platform users. Since HydraDX is built as a parachain, it leverages Polkadot's high security, flexibility, and speed. 

The protocol is powered by a native token called HDX, which is used to incentivize some aspects of the platform. It has a variable supply based on the amount of liquidity locked in the protocol. the Omnipool unlocks several advantages, including:

- **Capital-efficient trading:** Fewer hops and lower slippage for users.
- **Sustainable liquidity:** Single-sided liquidity provisioning and LRNA token incentives encourage participation.
- **Trustless and secure:** Built on Polkadot, offering inherent security and interoperability.

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the HydraDX Protocol , delving into its design, functionalities, risks, area of Improvement , Codebase uality anaysis , Learning and insights and overall Recommendations .



 ### Design and Functionality

 #### 1 . Single Pool Architecture

Unlike traditional AMMs that require separate liquidity pools for each token pair, the Omnipool utilizes a single pool to accommodate all tradable assets. This approach eliminates liquidity fragmentation, leading to several benefits

- **Reduced slippage:** Trades occur within a single, deep pool, minimizing price impact.
- **Improved capital efficiency:** Users can swap between any two assets with fewer intermediary steps, reducing transaction costs.
- **Simplified asset management:** Liquidity providers only need to deposit a single asset (LRNA) to participate.

#### 2 .  LRNA Hub Token

The Omnipool utilizes LRNA as the "hub" token, acting as an intermediary for all trades. This design offers several advantages

- **Universal routing:** All trades are routed through LRNA, ensuring efficient price discovery and liquidity utilization.
- **Fee distribution:** Transaction fees and partial impermanent loss (IL) mitigation are distributed in LRNA, incentivizing token holding and participation.
- **Single-sided liquidity provisioning:** Users can deposit any supported asset into the pool in exchange for LRNA, simplifying liquidity provision.

#### 3 . Additional Features

The Omnipool offers several additional features that enhance its functionality and security

- **Liquidity caps:** Prevent excessive exposure to volatile assets and maintain pool stability.
- **Protocol fees:** Generate revenue for the protocol to support development and incentivize participation.
- **Circuit breakers:** Automatically halt trading during extreme market conditions to protect users.

- Developers can interact with Bitcoin (BTC), Polkadot (DOT), ERC-based coins, and other blockchain-based assets.




## How HydraDX Operates

HydraDX uses automated market-making (AMM) to determine the asset prices in pools, it moves away from the conventional AMM model. To better understand HydraDX’s price discovery options, let’s look at where it’s applied.

The protocol uses a single decentralized pool which it calls an ocean thanks to its flexibility in expansion. The pool’s liquidity comes from individual liquidity providers and the platform itself. Interestingly, this approach allows it to combine features from traditional DeFi platforms such as Uniswap and Balancer to provide an enhanced network for users.

![HydraDXOperates](https://github.com/kaveyjoe/w01/blob/main/HydraDX%20Operates.png)

Liquidity from the protocol uses the platform’s native currency, HDX (more on this later). Furthermore, half of the pool is made up of HDX while the remaining percentage comes from LPs. The number of tokens minted depends on the activity on the pool.



## HydraDX’s Native Token (HDX) and Governance


HydraDX’s native currency is called HDX. Its minting depends on the tokens provided by LPs on the single pool. As such, the more assets, the more HDX tokens are minted. On the other hand, when LPs withdraw their assets from the pool, the platform ensures equilibrium by burning more HDX.

HDX can be traded with other assets in the pool or bought outside the platform. The pool currently supports the platform’s base asset, Ethereum (ETH), and Polkadot (DOT).

**HDX use cases**

Apart from providing liquidity in the pool, HDX has more use cases. For instance

- It is used as a reference point when pricing an asset in terms of another asset.
- As such, it guards against price slippage and improves capital efficiency. Note that price slippage is among the key issues troubling DeFi platforms employing conventional AMM features.
- Interestingly, HydraDX’s approach enables LPs to provide single assets for liquidity. HDX allows the protocol to live up to its comparison with an ocean. How? The ocean can expand and shrink at will depending on the liquidity.
- Consequently, HydraDX’s omni pool, using the native currency, is able to expand and shrink depending on the “inflow and outflow of assets.” In doing so, the network reduces liquidity scattering while enhancing execution.

![HDX use](https://github.com/kaveyjoe/w01/blob/main/HDX%20use.png)
Observe that the approach taken by HydraDX enables the native currency to be backed by all tokens deposited in the omni pool.

- HDX also doubles up as a staking token where it can be locked in a wallet, allowing holders to participate in finding new blocks on a proof of stake blockchain. Additionally, HDX holders benefit from discounted trading costs and a lower over-collateralization ratio when borrowing from the network.

#  Overiew & Analysis

## 1. Omnipool
The omnipool is the primary liquidity pool for non-stablecoin assets in HydraDX. It uses the x*y=k invariant and implements functions for swapping assets, adding and removing liquidity, and checking the invariant. It has a well-structured architecture, and its functions are securely implemented.

**Functionality**
- Creates and manages liquidity pools for various assets.
- Enables users to deposit and withdraw assets into/from pools.
- Facilitates swaps between different assets within a pool.
- Distributes swap fees to liquidity providers.

**Mechanism**
- Employs a constant product automated market maker (AMM) model, where the price of an asset is determined by the following formula: price = reserve_in / reserve_out.
- Users can add liquidity by depositing equal amounts of two assets into a pool, creating or increasing their pool shares.
- Swaps involve exchanging one asset for another within the pool, altering the respective reserves and consequently adjusting the price based on the constant product formula.
- A portion of the swap fees is collected by the protocol and distributed proportionally to liquidity providers based on their pool share.



**Design Principles**
Omnipool adheres to several key design principles
- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain full ownership over their funds throughout the entire lifecycle of interactions with the pool.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support large volumes of transactions while maintaining efficiency and low latency.
- **Security**: Implemented with robust security measures, including regular security audits and best practices for smart contract development.
- **Decentralization**: Built upon the Substrate framework, enabling interoperability across various blockchains within the Polkadot ecosyste

**Structures**

- **CurrencyId**: a type alias for [u8; 32] used to represent token identifiers in the omnipool.
- **Balance**: a type alias for u128 used as the base currency type throughout the pallet.
- **PoolId**: a unique identifier for liquidity pools within the omnipool, generated by hashing the currency IDs of the tokens in the pool.
- **Monomial**: a generic structure representing a simple polynomial term, consisting of a Coefficient (a generic Balance) and an Exponent (a generic u32).
- **VirtualPrice**: a structure that represents the virtual price of a pool, derived from the ratio of the spot price to the geometric mean of the virtual prices of the adjacent pools.

**Functions**

- **add_liquidity**: an extrinsic that allows users to add liquidity to the pool with a specified min_proceeds. It takes a reference to the token IDs and the desired amounts for each token as input.
- **remove_liquidity**: an extrinsic that allows users to remove liquidity from a pool with a specified min_liquidity. It takes a reference to the pool ID and the desired amount to remove as input.
- **swap**: an extrinsic that allows users to swap tokens with a specified min_output_amount. It takes a reference to the token IDs of the input and output tokens, along with the desired input amount, as input.
- **set_virtual_price**: a privileged function that allows adjustment of the virtual price for a specific pool. It updates the stored virtual price, and may trigger recalculations of other dependent virtual prices.
- **calculate_virtual_prices**: a private function that calculates the virtual prices of a pool based on the spot price and the virtual prices of its adjacent pools.
- **adjust_spot_price**: a private function that updates the spot price given the current pool balance and fees. The function implements a simple linear interpolation between the current spot price and the mid-price.




## 2. StableSwap

Stableswap is a specific implementation of the AMM (Automated Market Maker) design for managing liquidity pools of stablecoins in HydraDX. By utilizing a constant product-constant sum invariant, stableswap ensures that the price remains close to the target price. It includes functions for swapping assets, adding and removing liquidity, and updating the target price.

**Functionality**
- Caters specifically to liquidity pools containing stablecoins.
- Maintains price stability within the pool despite fluctuations in individual stablecoin prices.

**Mechanism**
- Utilizes a stableswap invariant, a more complex formula compared to the constant product AMM, to achieve price stability. This formula incorporates an additional parameter, "amplification coefficient," that controls the degree of price deviation from the peg.
- The amplification coefficient is typically set higher for stablecoin pools compared to regular AMM pools to minimize price divergence from the expected peg between the stablecoins.
- Swaps and liquidity provision function similarly to the Omnipool, but the price calculations are governed by the stableswap invariant formula.


**Structures**
- **Balance**: a type alias for u128 used as the base currency type throughout the pallet.
- **CurrencyId**: a type alias for [u8; 32] used to represent token identifiers in the stableswap.
- **StablePoolId**: a unique identifier for stable pools, generated by composing the currency IDs of the pool's tokens.

**Functions**
- **swap**: an extrinsic that allows users to swap tokens between stable pools. The function calculates the input and output token quantities considering the constant product invariant.
- **join_pool**: an extrinsic that allows users to create or increase an existing LP position in a stable pool.
- **exit_pool**: an extrinsic that allows users to remove or decrease an existing LP position in a stable pool.
- **update_weights**: a privileged function that allows adjustment of the weights for a specific stable pool. Weights determine the token's share in the pool and are critical to maintaining the stablecoin's price stability.

## 3. EMA Oracle
The EMA (Exponential Moving Average) oracle is responsible for providing price information to the HydraDX protocol. It calculates the EMA based on price observations from external sources and updates the EMA value accordingly. The EMA oracle is a crucial component, as it impacts trading decisions within the HydraDX ecosystem.

**Functionality**
- Provides price feeds for assets using an exponentially moving average (EMA) mechanism.
- Aggregates past prices to generate a smooth price curve, potentially reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations.

**Mechanism**
- Maintains a time-series of past prices for each asset.
- At regular intervals, the EMA oracle calculates a new price by applying a weighting factor to the most recent price and the previous EMA value.
- The weighting factor determines the responsiveness of the EMA to recent price changes. A higher weighting factor gives more weight to recent prices, resulting in a more volatile price curve, while a lower weighting factor smooths out fluctuations but may lag behind rapid price movements.
- Smart contracts can access the EMA oracle to retrieve the latest price feed for an asset.


**Structures**
- **Balance**: a type alias for u128 used as the base currency type throughout the pallet.
- **CurrencyId**: a type alias for [u8; 32] used to represent token identifiers in the EMA oracle.
- **EmaConfig**: a structure containing the ema oracle's settings, such as the window size, alpha factor, and price field.

**Functions**
- **update_ema**: a function for updating the EMA of a price field for a specific token based on its current EMA, the new price, and the appropriate alpha factor.
- **set_price**: a privileged function that allows adjustment of the price field for a specific token.


## 4. Circuit Breaker
The circuit breaker module protects the HydraDX protocol from sudden and extreme market fluctuations. It manages three states (open, half-open, and closed) and defines conditions for transitioning between these states. Implementing a circuit breaker is essential to mitigate risks associated with extreme market volatility.


**Functionality**
- Introduces a safeguard mechanism to halt trading activities in liquidity pools under specific conditions.
- Aims to prevent potential losses for users during periods of extreme price volatility or pool imbalances.

**Mechanism**
-  Continuously monitors various factors, such as price movements, pool reserves, and trading volume.
- If predefined thresholds for these factors are exceeded (e.g., sharp price drops, significant reserve depletion), the circuit breaker is triggered, pausing all swaps within the affected pool.
- Once the conditions improve and stabilize within acceptable ranges, the circuit breaker is deactivated, and trading resumes. 

**Structures**
- **CircuitBreakerStatus**: an enumeration representing the state of the circuit breaker, which can be Open, Closed, or HalfClosed.
- **CircuitBreakerConfig**: a structure containing the configuration for the circuit breaker, such as the maximum deviation or the period of time from open to closed status.

**Functions**
- **open_circuit_breaker**: a privileged function that opens the circuit breaker if current conditions meet the specified configuration.
- **close_circuit_breaker**: a privileged function that closes the circuit breaker, permitting trades to continue.
- **set_circuit_breaker_status**: a privileged function that sets the circuit breaker's status explicitly.
- **calculate_current_deviation**: a function that calculates the price deviation based on the EMA and the latest price feed.





## Function  Invarients 
### 1 . Omnipool


| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $R_i$ | Omnipool reserves of asset $i$ |
| $Q_i$ | LRNA in subpool for asset $i$ |
| $S_i$ | Shares in asset $i$ subpool |
| $\omega_i$ | Weight cap for asset $i$ in Omnipool |

For a given state variable $X$, we will generally denote the value of $X$ *after* the operation by $X^+$.

[Omnipool Specification](https://github.com/galacticcouncil/HydraDX-simulations/blob/main/hydradx/spec/OmnipoolSpec.ipynb)



#### Swap

- For all assets $i$ in Omnipool, the invariant $R_i Q_i$ should not decrease due to a swap. This means that after a swap for all assets $i$ in Omnipool:

$$
R_i^+ Q_i^+ \geq R_i Q_i
$$

- $R_iQ_i$ should be invariant, but one is calculated from the other. If e.g. $R_i^+$ is calculated it may have error up to $1$, in which case the product $R_i^+Q_i^+$ may have error up to $Q_i^+$. If $Q_i^+$ is calculated, then the product has error up to $R_i^+$. Thus we should always be able to bound the error by $max(R_i^+,Q_i^+)$, giving us

$$
R_i Q_i + max(R_i^+, Q_i^+) \geq R_i^+ Q_i^+
$$

#### Add liquidity

- Add liquidity should respect price $\frac{Q_i}{R_i}$. This means $\frac{Q_i}{R_i} = \frac{Q_i^+}{R_i^+}$, or $Q_i R_i^+ = Q_i^+ R_i$. What is most important here is not which direction we round but the accuracy. So we must test that

$$
(Q_i^+ - 1)R_i \leq Q_i R_i^+ \leq (Q_i^+ + 1)R_i
$$

- Adding liquidity in asset $i$ should keep the ratio of assets per shares constant. We round so as to not decrease the assets per share of asset $i$, $\frac{R_i}{S_i}$; that is, we favor the other LPs over the LP currently adding liquidity, to avoid any potential exploit. This means, $\frac{R_i^+}{S_i^+}\geq \frac{R_i}{S_i}$, so

$$
R_i (S_i^+ + 1) \geq R_i^+ S_i \geq R_i S_i^+
$$

- Adding liquidity needs to respect weight caps. That is,

$$
\omega_iQ^+ \geq Q_i^+
$$

#### Withdraw liquidity

- Withdraw liquidity should respect price $\frac{Q_i}{R_i}$. This means $\frac{Q_i}{R_i} = \frac{Q_i^+}{R_i^+}$, or $Q_i R_i^+ = Q_i^+ R_i$. Allowing for rounding error, we must check

$$
(Q_i^+ - 1)R_i \leq Q_i R_i^+ \leq (Q_i^+ + 1)R_i
$$

- Withdraw liquidity in asset $i$ should keep the ratio of assets per shares constant. We round so as to not decrease the assets per share of asset $i$, $\frac{R_i}{S_i}$; that is, we favor the other LPs over the LP currently withdrawing liquidity, to avoid any potential exploit. This means $\frac{R_i^+}{S_i^+}\geq \frac{R_i}{S_i}$, so

$$
R_i (S_i^+ + 1) \geq R_i^+ S_i \geq R_i S_i^+
$$




### 2 .  Stableswap 





| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $R_i$ | Stableswap reserve of asset $i$ |
| $S$ | Shares in stableswap pool |
| $D$ | Stableswap invariant |

For a given state variable $X$, we will generally denote the value of $X$ *after* the operation by $X^+$.



#### Swap

- After a swap, we should have

$$
D + 5000 \geq D^+ \geq D
$$

### Add Liquidity (arbitrary assets)

- After adding liquidity, we should have

$$
D^+ \geq D
$$

$$
D^+ S \geq D S^+ \geq (D^+ - 1)S
$$

#### Withdraw Liquidity (one asset)

- After removing liquidity, we should have

$$
D^+\leq D
$$

$$
D(S^+ + 1) \geq D^+ S \geq D S^+
$$

## How does HydraDX  work?


HydraDX is an advanced decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers a seamless and efficient platform for trading and managing digital assets. In this part, we will talking about  the technical, comprehensive, and detailed workings of HydraDX, delving into its core components and how they interact to provide users with a robust and secure trading experience.

To begin with HydraDX, users must create an account and integrate a wallet, such as Talisman, Nova Wallet, or Polkadot Extension, to manage their HydraDX assets securely.

Once the wallet is connected, users can transfer assets between their wallets and dive into the Omnipool — HydraDX platform, enabling them to participate in trading activities and liquidity provisions.

HydraDX allows users to swap between various digital assets using its unified Omnipool. This process involves the user submitting an order matched with an available liquidity pool in the Omnipool.

The exchange rate for the asset swap is determined by the CPMM algorithm, which ensures that the product of the pool's assets and their respective weights remain constant during the transaction.

HydraDX leverages Polkadot's XCM protocol for cross-chain asset swaps, enabling seamless integration of various cryptocurrencies and allowing users to trade across different blockchain networks.

Users can provide liquidity to Omnipool by depositing their assets, which are then used to facilitate trades within the platform. In return, liquidity providers receive LP tokens representing their pool share.

HydraDX offers various incentives for users who contribute liquidity, including a share of the trading fees generated by the platform and additional rewards in the form of native HDX tokens.


## HydraDX Liquidity and Financial Features

- The team behind HydraDX has invested over $20 million in liquidity, making it a significant proof of concept and the foundation for future development.

While there are some complex mathematical functions in the codebase, they are well-documented and easy to understand. The inclusion of tests and security features also helps ensure that the code is correct and secure. Overall, the HydraDX codebase is a good example of best practices for writing Substrate-based code.

## Centralization and Systematic Risks 
**1 . Omnipool and Stableswap**
- Impermanent Loss: Due to the nature of Automated Market Makers (AMMs), liquidity providers may experience impermanent loss, which can be significant in volatile markets. This risk might discourage liquidity providers and lead to reduced liquidity, impacting the trading experience for users.
- Concentration of Liquidity: If a few liquidity providers hold a large portion of the pool, they can exert significant price pressure and manipulate the market, posing a centralization risk.
- Front-Running: Miners or validators might potentially front-run transactions, leading to unfair price advantage at the expense of other traders.

**2 . EMA Oracle**
- Price Manipulation: A malicious actor controlling a significant portion of the liquidity can manipulate prices, potentially affecting the accuracy of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) oracle.
- Central Point of Failure: Relying on a single EMA oracle for price feeds can create a central point of failure. If the oracle is compromised or goes offline, it can impact the entire system.
- Malicious Data Feed: If the EMA oracle is based on data from a centralized or unreliable source, the system might be susceptible to manipulation and inaccurate price feeds.

**3 . Circuit Breaker**
- Centralized Control: The Circuit Breaker pallet relies on a centralized authority to trigger emergency pauses and unpauses. This centralized control can lead to potential misuse and might not be transparent.
- Emergency Pause/Unpause Risk: An unintended emergency pause or unpause can cause significant disruptions to the ecosystem.

## Recommendations
- Implement strict input validations and checks for all functions, ensuring users provide proper input argument values to prevent unintended behavior and security loopholes. Consider using proper error handling and returning meaningful error messages to aid debugging and improve user experience.
- Implement and enforce proper access control policies and roles, ensuring only authorized contract accounts and users can call specific functions. Consider using modifiers or custom logic for access control.
Ensure all external functions are called within the correct contract context by explicitly specifying the msg.sender as the caller, avoiding unintended consequences and unexpected behavior.
- When using the . notation to access struct fields, ensure checks are in place for the existence of such structs and their fields to prevent panic conditions and ensure proper contract behavior.
- Use assert!() or ensure!() macros to validate all internal state transition invariants, conditions, and assumptions. This will help maintain the correct state and contract behavior.
- Likewise, use require!() macros to validate user input parameters, external contract calls, and any other condition that can lead to aborting the transaction or preventing unnecessary execution costs.
- Leverage advanced security tools and static analyzers to identify potential security vulnerabilities, coding issues, and bad practices, such as Mythril, Oyente, Mythrix, and Slither.
- Optimize core business logic and mathematical calculations using arithmetic optimizations and smart contracts libraries, such as OpenZeppelin's library for solidity, to help with safe and secure arithmetic operations.
- Ensure adequate test coverage for all critical contract functionalities, edge cases, and potential security vulnerabilities. Utilize fuzzing, unit tests, and integration tests to validate and validate contract behaviour.
- While the codebase includes some comments and documentation, there are several areas where additional documentation would be helpful. In particular, some of the mathematical functions and structures could benefit from more detailed explanations and examples.
-Some of the variable and function names in the codebase are not very descriptive, which can make it harder to understand the code. Using more descriptive names can help make the code more readable and easier to understand.
- While the HydraDX codebase is well-written and well-organized, there are some areas where the code could be simplified. For example, some of the mathematical functions include several nested calls to other functions, which can make the code harder to read and understand. Simplifying the code where possible can help make it more readable and easier to maintain.
- The HydraDX codebase includes some error handling, but there are some areas where additional error handling could be beneficial. In particular, adding more error handling to the mathematical functions can help ensure the correctness of the code and prevent errors from propagating through the system.
